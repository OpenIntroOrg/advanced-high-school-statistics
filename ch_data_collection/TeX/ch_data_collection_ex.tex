\eoce{\qt{Migraine and acupuncture}
A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a completely randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. 43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at nonacupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the contingency table below. \footfullcite{Allais:2011}

\eoce{\qt{Sinusitis and antibiotics, Part I\label{sinusitis}} Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis compared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to one of two groups: treatment or control. Study participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an antibiotic) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste. The placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc. At the end of the 10-day period patients were asked if they experienced significant improvement in symptoms. The distribution of responses are summarized below. \footfullcite{Garbutt:2012}

\eoce{\qt{Identify study components, Part I\label{components1}} Identify (i) the cases, (ii) the variables and their types, and (iii) the main research question in the studies described below.
\textA{\vspace{2mm}}
\begin{parts}
\item Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Specifically, levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM$_{10}$) in $\mu g/m^3$. Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM$_{10}$ and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births. \footfullcite{Ritz+Yu+Chapa+Fruin:2000}
\textA{\vspace{2mm}}
\item The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These patients were split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life. \footfullcite{McDowan:2003}

\eoce{\qt{Identify study components, Part II\label{components2}} Identify (i) the cases, (ii) the variables and their types, and (iii) the main research question of the studies described below.
\begin{parts}
\item Researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age and self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15. Participants reported their age, sex, and whether they were an only child or not. The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet, and said they they would only reward children who report white. Half the students were explicitly told not to cheat and the others were not given any explicit instructions. In the no instruction group probability of cheating was found to be uniform across groups based on child's characteristics. In the group that was explicitly told to not cheat, girls were less likely to cheat, and while rate of cheating didn't vary by age for boys, it decreased with age for girls. \footfullcite{Bucciol:2011} \label{luck_cheat}
\item In a study of the relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior, 129 University of California undergraduates at Berkeley were asked to identify themselves as having low or high social-class by comparing themselves to others with the most (least) money, most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs. They were also presented  with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that they were for children in a nearby laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted. Participants completed unrelated tasks and then reported the number of candies they had taken. It was found that those in the upper-class rank condition took more candy than did those in the lower-rank condition. \footfullcite{Piff:2012}

\eoce{\qt{Haters are gonna hate, study confirms} A study published in the \textit{Journal of Personality and Social Psychology} asked a group of 200 randomly sampled men and women to evaluate how they felt about various subjects, such as camping, health care, architecture, taxidermy, crossword puzzles, and Japan in order to measure their dispositional attitude towards mostly independent stimuli. Then, they presented the participants with information about a new product: a microwave oven. This microwave oven does not exist, but the participants didn't know this, and were given three positive and three negative fake reviews. People who reacted positively to the subjects on the dispositional attitude measurement also tended to react positively to the microwave oven, and those who reacted negatively also tended to react negatively to it.

\eoce{\qt{Flawed reasoning} Identify the flaw(s) in reasoning in the following scenarios. Explain what the individuals in the study should have done differently if they wanted to make such strong conclusions.
\begin{parts}
\item Students at an elementary school are given a questionnaire that they are asked to return after their parents have completed it. One of the questions asked is, ``Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to spend time with your kids after school?" Of the parents who replied, 85\% said ``no". Based on these results, the school officials conclude that a great majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time with their kids after school.
\item A survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 women who recently gave birth, asking them about whether or not they smoked during pregnancy. A follow-up survey asking if the children have respiratory problems is conducted 3 years later, however, only 567 of these women are reached at the same address. The researcher reports that these 567 women are representative of all mothers.

\begin{parts}
\item An article titled \emph{Risks: Smokers Found More Prone to Dementia} states the following: \footfullcite{news:smokingDementia}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{1em}
{\footnotesize ``Researchers analyzed data from 23,123 health plan members who participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to 1985, when they were 50-60 years old. 23 years later, about 25\% of the group had dementia, including 1,136 with Alzheimer's disease and 416 with vascular dementia. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that pack-a-day smokers were 37\% more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia, and the risks went up with increased smoking; 44\% for one to two packs a day; and twice the risk for more than two packs."}
\end{adjustwidth}
Based on this study, can we conclude that smoking causes dementia later in life? Explain your reasoning.
\item Another article titled \emph{The School Bully Is Sleepy} states the following: \footfullcite{news:bullySleep}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{1em}
{\footnotesize ``The University of Michigan study, collected survey data from parents on each child's sleep habits and asked both parents and teachers to assess behavioral concerns. About a third of the students studied were identified by parents or teachers as having problems with disruptive behavior or bullying. The researchers found that children who had behavioral issues and those who were identified as bullies were twice as likely to have shown symptoms of sleep disorders."}

They also hypothesized that shy individuals might have fewer Facebook ``friends" as they tend to have fewer friends than non-shy individuals have in the offline world. 103 undergraduate students at an Ontario university were surveyed via online questionnaires. The study states ``Participants were recruited through the university's psychology participation pool. After indicating an interest in the study, participants were sent an e-mail containing the study's URL."

\eoce{\qt{Multitaskers, Part I} Researchers studying the effect of TV watching while studying on school performance conducted the following studies. For each study determine (i) the type of study (observational or experiment), (ii) if there is random sampling, (iii) if there is random assignment, (iv) state the scope of the conclusions of the study, and (v) note if stratifying, blocking, or neither of these techniques were used in the study.
\begin{parts}
\item Researchers randomly sampled 100 high school students and asked them whether or not they watched TV while studying. They found that the mean grade point average of students who did not watch TV while studying was significantly higher than the mean grade point average of students who did watch TV while studying.
\item Researchers randomly sampled 50 female and 50 male high school students and asked them whether or not they watched TV while studying. They found that the mean grade point average of both males and females who did not watch TV while doing homework was significantly higher than the mean grade point average of students who did watch TV while doing homework. \textA{\textbf{(Note that there is a part~(c) on the next page.)}}
\item Researchers randomly sampled 100 high school students and randomly assigned them into two study groups. Throughout the school year, one group was told to study in a room with a TV on while the other was told to study in silence. At the end of the year the researchers compared the grade point averages of the two groups and found that the mean grade point average of students who did not watch TV while studying was significantly higher than the grade point average of students who did watch TV while studying.

\begin{parts}
\item Researchers randomly sampled 50 female and 50 male high school students. Half of the females and half of the males were randomly assigned to study in a room with a TV and the remainder studied without a TV. They found that the mean grade point average of both males and females who did not watch TV while studying was significantly higher than those who did watch TV while studying.
\item Researchers surveyed the first 100 students who showed up to prom. They found that the mean grade point average of students who did not watch TV while studying was higher than the mean grade point average for students who did watch TV while studying.
\item Researchers surveyed the first 50 male and 50 female students who showed up to prom. They found that the mean grade point average of both males and females who did not watch TV while doing homework was higher than the mean grade point average of students who did watch TV while studying.

\eoce{\qt{Multitaskers, Part III} Suppose a friend of yours wants to design his own study for evaluating the effect of TV watching on school performance. He proposes comparing the grade point averages of everyone in his homeroom class who do and do not watch TV while doing homework, and extending the results of this study to draw conclusions about all high schoolers. Indicate any mistakes with this design, keeping in mind that the goal of the study is to assess the causal relationship between TV watching and school performance for high schoolers.

\eoce{\qt{Multitaskers, Part IV} Suppose two friends of yours want to design their own study for evaluating the effect of TV watching on school performance. They propose the following designs. Indicate any mistakes with these designs, keeping in mind that the goal of the study is to assess the causal relationship between TV watching and school performance for high schoolers.
\begin{parts}
\item Randomly sample 100 students from the entire school. Reserve two classrooms for a study session and the first 50 people that show up get assigned to the room where the TV will be on and the rest to the room where they can study in silence for a final exam. Then compare the average grades of the two groups at the end of the semester.
\item Age and involvement in extracurricular activities may be factors that affect the academic performance of a student, so these characteristics should be blocked for when studying the effect of watching TV while studying. To achieve this aim, sample 10 first-years, 10 sophomores, 10 juniors, and 10 seniors, 5 of which are heavily involved with extracurricular activities and 5 of which are not from each class. Then ask them whether they watch TV while they study, and compare the average GPAs of those who do and do not.

\eoce{\qt{Improving life satisfaction} In a study evaluating the effectiveness of a positive psychology group intervention, forty middle schoolers who were identified as being less than delighted with their lives (reported life satisfaction scores between 1 and 6 on a 7-point scale) were randomly assigned to receive the intervention (treatment) or not receive the intervention (control). These students were first matched on attributes such as sex, socioeconomic group, race/ethnicity, and age, such that each student in the treatment group had a matched counterpart in the control group. Researchers found that life satisfaction of students in the intervention group increased significantly,  while the control group declined during the same period (although this change was not statistically significant). \footfullcite{Suldo:2014}
\begin{parts}
\item What type of study is this?
\item What type of design is used in this study?
\item Can the results of this study be used to establish a causal link between the intervention and increased life satisfaction in middle schoolers?

\eoce{\qt{Alfalfa plants} Researchers were interested in the effect that acid has on the growth rate of alfalfa plants. They created three treatment groups in an experiment: low acid ($+$), high acid ($\triangle$), and control ($\ocircle$). The alfalfa plants were grown in a Styrofoam cups arranged near a window and the height of the alfalfa plants was measured after five days of growth. The experiment consisted of 6 cups for each of the 3 treatments, for a total of 18 observations. Which of the following designs is preferable? Note that the dotted line indicates the location of the window. Explain your reasoning.

\eoce{\qt{Chocolate chip cookies} We would like to compare two cookie recipes, one from a popular recipe website and another from the back of a bag of chocolate chips. We will bake 24 cookies, 12 of each type, and then have a friend rate each cookie on a scale of 1 to 10. Both sets of cookies are supposed to be baked for the same amount of time and at the same temperature: 9 minutes at 350F. We will use an old oven available to students in the school, which tends to overheat a little near the oven's back.
\begin{parts}
\item Would we bias our results if we cooked one type of cookie first and the other second?
\item We instead decide to bake each batch simultaneously on the same tray, and decide to block for proximity to the back of the oven. Two blocking schemes shown below are under consideration. For each scheme, cookies made with the recipe from the website are indicated with a $+$ and cookies made with the other recipe are indicated with a $\ocircle$. The dashed line marks the back of the oven. Which of the blocking schemes, A or B, is better for this experiment? Explain your answer.
