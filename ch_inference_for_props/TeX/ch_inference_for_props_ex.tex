\eoce{\qt{Vegetarian college students} Suppose that 8\% of college students are vegetarians. Determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.
\begin{parts}
\item The distribution of the sample proportions of vegetarians in random samples of size 60 is approximately normal since $n \ge 30$. 
\item The distribution of the sample proportions of vegetarian college students in random samples of size 50 is right skewed.
\item A random sample of 125 college students where 12\% are vegetarians would be considered unusual. 
\item A random sample of 250 college students where 12\% are vegetarians would be considered unusual.
\item The standard error would be reduced by one-half if we increased the sample size from 125 to~250.

\begin{parts}
\item The distribution of sample proportions of random samples of size 30 is left skewed.
\item Using a sample size that is 4 times as large will reduce the standard error of the sample proportion by one-half.

\eoce{\qt{Young Americans, Part II} About 25\% of young Americans have delayed starting a family due to the continued economic slump. Determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.\footfullcite{news:youngAmericans2}
\begin{parts}
\item The distribution of sample proportions of young Americans who have delayed starting a family due to the continued economic slump in random samples of size 12 is right skewed.
\item In order for the distribution of sample proportions of young Americans who have delayed starting a family due to the continued economic slump to be approximately normal, we need random samples where the sample size is at least 40.
\item A random sample of 50 young Americans where 20\% have delayed starting a family due to the continued economic slump would be considered unusual.
\item A random sample of 150 young Americans where 20\% have delayed starting a family due to the continued economic slump would be considered unusual.
\item Tripling the sample size will reduce the standard error of the sample proportion by one-third.

\eoce{\qt{Prop 19 in California} In a 2010 Survey USA poll, 70\% of the 119 respondents between the ages of 18 and 34 said they would vote in the 2010 general election for Prop 19, which would change California law to legalize marijuana and allow it to be regulated and taxed. At a 95\% confidence level, this sample has an 8\% margin of error. Based on this information, determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.\footfullcite{data:prop19_and_offshoreDrill}
\begin{parts}
\item We are 95\% confident that between 62\% and 78\% of the California voters in this sample support Prop 19.
\item We are 95\% confident that between 62\% and 78\% of all California voters between the ages of 18 and 34 support Prop 19.
\item If we considered many random samples of 119 California voters between the ages of 18 and 34, and we calculated 95\% confidence intervals for each, 95\% of them will include the true population proportion of 18-34 year old Californians who support Prop 19.
\item In order to decrease the margin of error to 4\%, we would need to quadruple (multiply by 4) the sample size.
\item Based on this confidence interval, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that a majority of California voters between the ages of 18 and 34 support Prop 19.

\eoce{\qt{2010 Healthcare Law} On June 28, 2012 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the much debated 2010 healthcare law, declaring it constitutional. A Gallup poll released the day after this decision indicates that 46\% of 1,012 Americans agree with this decision. At a 95\% confidence level, this sample has a 3\% margin of error. Based on this information, determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.\footfullcite{data:healthcare2010}
\begin{parts}
\item We are 95\% confident that between  43\% and 49\% of Americans in this sample support the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court on the 2010 healthcare law.
\item We are 95\% confident that between 43\% and 49\% of Americans support the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court on the 2010 healthcare law.
\item If we considered many random samples of 1,012 Americans, and we calculated the sample proportions of those who support the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, 95\% of those sample proportions will be between  43\% and 49\%.
\item The margin of error at a 90\% confidence level would be higher than 3\%.

\eoce{\qt{Elderly drivers} In January 2011, The Marist Poll published a report stating that 66\% of adults nationally think licensed drivers should be required to retake their road test once they reach 65 years of age. It was also reported that interviews were conducted on 1,018 American adults, and that the margin of error was 3\% using a 95\% confidence level. \footfullcite{data:elderlyDriving}
\begin{parts}
\item Verify the margin of error reported by The Marist Poll. 
\item Based on a 95\% confidence interval, does the poll provide convincing evidence that \textit{more than} 70\% of the population think that licensed drivers should be required to retake their road test once they turn 65?

\eoce{\qt{Study abroad} A survey on 1,509 high school seniors who took the SAT and who completed an optional web survey between April 25 and April 30, 2007 shows that 55\% of high school seniors are fairly certain that they will participate in a study abroad program in college.\footfullcite{data:studyAbroad}
\begin{parts}
\item Is this sample a representative sample from the population of all high school seniors in the US? Explain your reasoning.
\item Let's suppose the conditions for inference are met. Even if your answer to part (a) indicated that this approach would not be reliable, this analysis may still be interesting to carry out (though not report).

\eoce{\qt{Legalization of marijuana, Part I} \label{legalizeMarijuana} The 2010 General Social Survey asked 1,259 US residents: ``Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal, or not?" 48\% of the respondents said it should be made legal.\footfullcite{data:gss:2010}
\begin{parts}
\item Is 48\% a sample statistic or a population parameter? Explain.
\item Construct a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of US residents who think marijuana should be made legal, and interpret it in the context of the data.
\item A critic points out that this 95\% confidence interval is only accurate if the statistic follows a normal distribution, or if the normal model is a good approximation. Is this true for these data? Explain.
\item A news piece on this survey's findings states, ``Majority of Americans think marijuana should be legalized.'' Based on your confidence interval, is this news piece's statement justified?

\eoce{\qt{Public option, Part I} \label{publicOption} A \textit{Washington Post} article from 2009 reported that ``support for a government-run health-care plan to compete with private insurers has rebounded from its summertime lows and wins clear majority support from the public." More specifically, the article says ``seven in 10 Democrats back the plan, while almost nine in 10 Republicans oppose it. Independents divide 52 percent against, 42 percent in favor of the legislation." (6\% responded with ``other".) There were 819 Democrats, 566 Republicans and 783 Independents surveyed. \footfullcite{news:publicOption}
\begin{parts}
\item A political pundit on TV claims that a majority of Independents oppose the health care public option plan. Do these data provide strong evidence to support this statement?

Part I} \label{collegeWorthIt} Among a simple random sample of 331 American adults who do not have a four-year college degree and are not currently enrolled in school, 48\% said they decided not to go to college because they could not afford school. \footfullcite{data:collegeWorthIt}
\begin{parts}
\item A newspaper article states that only a minority of the Americans who decide not to go to college do so because they cannot afford it and uses the point estimate from this survey as evidence. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if these data provide strong evidence supporting this statement.

\eoce{\qt{Taste test}\label{sodaDietReg}\ \videohref{ahss_eoce_sol-taste_test_HT}\ \ Some people claim that they can tell the difference between a diet soda and a regular soda in the first sip. A researcher wanting to test this claim randomly sampled 80 such people. He then filled 80 plain white cups with soda, half diet and half regular through random assignment, and asked each person to take one sip from their cup and identify the soda as diet or regular. 53 participants correctly identified the soda.
\begin{parts}
\item Do these data provide strong evidence that these people are able to detect the difference between diet and regular soda, in other words, are the results significantly better than just random guessing?
\item Interpret the p-value in this context.

\eoce{\qt{Acetaminophen and liver damage} It is believed that large doses of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in over the counter pain relievers like Tylenol) may cause damage to the liver. A researcher wants to conduct a study to estimate the proportion of acetaminophen users who have liver damage. For participating in this study, he will pay each subject \$20 and provide a free medical consultation if the patient has liver damage.
\begin{parts}
\item If he wants to limit the margin of error of his 98\% confidence interval to 2\%, what is the minimum amount of money he needs to set aside to pay his subjects?
\item The amount you calculated in part (a) is substantially over his budget so he decides to use fewer subjects. How will this affect the width of his confidence interval?

\eoce{\qt{Social experiment, Part I} \label{socExp} A ``social experiment" conducted by a TV program questioned what people do when they see a very obviously bruised woman getting picked on by her boyfriend. On two different occasions at the same restaurant, the same couple was depicted. In one scenario the woman was dressed ``provocatively'' and in the other scenario the woman was dressed ``conservatively''. The table below shows how many restaurant diners were present under each scenario, and whether or not they intervened.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll cc c} 
			&				& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Scenario}} \\
\cline{3-4}

\eoce{\qt{Heart transplant success} The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each patient entering the program was officially designated a heart transplant candidate, meaning that he was gravely ill and might benefit from a new heart. Patients were randomly assigned into treatment and control groups. Patients in the treatment group received a transplant, and those in the control group did not. The table below displays how many patients survived and died in each group. \footfullcite{Turnbull+Brown+Hu:1974}\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rcc}
  \hline
 & control & treatment \\ 
  \hline
alive &   4 &  24 \\ 
  dead &  30 &  45 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
A hypothesis test would reject the conclusion that the survival rate is the same in each group, and so we might like to calculate a confidence interval. Explain why we cannot construct such an interval using the normal approximation. What might go wrong if we constructed the confidence interval despite this problem?

\eoce{\qt{Gender and color preference} A 2001 study asked 1,924 male and 3,666 female undergraduate college students their favorite color. A 95\% confidence interval for the difference between the proportions of males and females whose favorite color is black $(p_{male} - p_{female})$ was calculated to be (0.02, 0.06). Based on this information, determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning for each statement you identify as false.\footfullcite{Ellis:2001}
\begin{parts}
\item We are 95\% confident that the true proportion of males whose favorite color is black is 2\% lower to 6\% higher than the true proportion of females whose favorite color is black.
\item We are 95\% confident that the true proportion of males whose favorite color is black is 2\% to 6\% higher than the true proportion of females whose favorite color is black.
\item 95\% of random samples will produce 95\% confidence intervals that include the true difference between the population proportions of males and females whose favorite color is black.
\item We can conclude that there is a significant difference between the proportions of males and females whose favorite color is black and that the difference between the two sample proportions is too large to plausibly be due to chance.
\item The 95\% confidence interval for $(p_{female} - p_{male})$ cannot be calculated with only the information given in this exercise.

\eoce{\qt{The Daily Show} A 2010 Pew Research foundation poll indicates that among 1,099 college graduates, 33\% watch The Daily Show. Meanwhile, 22\% of the 1,110 people with a high school degree but no college degree in the poll watch The Daily Show. A 95\% confidence interval for $(p_\text{college grad} - p_\text{HS or less})$, where $p$ is the proportion of those who watch The Daily Show, is (0.07, 0.15). Based on this information, determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning if you identify the statement as false.\footfullcite{data:dailyShow}
\begin{parts}
\item At the 5\% significance level, the data provide convincing evidence of a difference between the proportions of college graduates and those with a high school degree or less who watch The Daily Show.
\item We are 95\% confident that 7\% less to 15\% more college graduates watch The Daily Show than those with a high school degree or less.
\item 95\% of random samples of 1,099 college graduates and 1,110 people with a high school degree or less will yield differences in sample proportions between 7\% and 15\%.
\item A 90\% confidence interval for $(p_\text{college grad} - p_\text{HS or less})$ would be wider.
\item A 95\% confidence interval for $(p_\text{HS or less} - p_\text{college grad})$ is (-0.15,-0.07).

\begin{parts}
\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the difference between $(p_{D} - p_{I})$ and interpret it in this context. We have already checked conditions for you.
\item True or false: If we had picked a random Democrat and a random Independent at the time of this poll, it is more likely that the Democrat would support the public option than the Independent.

\eoce{\qt{HIV in sub-Saharan Africa} In July 2008 the US National Institutes of Health announced that it was stopping a clinical study early because of unexpected results. The study population consisted of HIV-infected women in sub-Saharan Africa who had been given single dose Nevaripine (a treatment for HIV) while giving birth, to prevent transmission of HIV to the infant.  The study was a randomized comparison of continued treatment of a woman (after successful childbirth) with Nevaripine vs. Lopinavir, a second drug used to treat HIV. 240 women participated in the study; 120 were randomized to each of the two treatments. Twenty-four weeks after starting the study treatment, each woman was tested to determine if the HIV infection was becoming worse (an outcome called \textit{virologic failure}). Twenty-six of the 120 women treated with Nevaripine experienced virologic failure, while 10 of the 120 women treated with the other drug experienced virologic failure. \footfullcite{Lockman:2007}
