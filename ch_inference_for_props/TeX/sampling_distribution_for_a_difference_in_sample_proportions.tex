\eoce{\qt{Difference of proportions, Part 1\label{difference_of_means_prob_1}}
The fraction of workers who are considered ``supercommuters'',
because they commute more than 90 minutes to get to work, varies by state.
Suppose the following were the exact values for Nebraska and New York:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
State & Proportion Supercommuters \\
\hline
Nebraska & 0.01 \\
New York & 0.06 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Now suppose that we plan a study to survey 1000 people from each state,
and we will compute the sample proportions $\hat{p}_{NE}$ for Nebraska
and $\hat{p}_{NY}$ for New York.
\begin{parts}
\item What is the associated mean and standard deviation of $\hat{p}_{NE}$?
\item What is the associated mean and standard deviation of $\hat{p}_{NY}$?
\item Calculate and interpret the mean and standard deviation associated with the difference in sample proportions for the two groups, $\hat{p}_{NY} - \hat{p}_{NE}$.
\item How are the standard deviations from parts~(a), (b), and~(c) related?
\end{parts}

Suppose the following were the exact values for Nebraska and New York:

\begin{tabular}{cc}

Now suppose that we plan a study to survey 1000 people from each state,
and we will compute the sample proportions $\hat{p}_{NE}$ for Nebraska
and $\hat{p}_{NY}$ for New York.
\begin{parts}
\item What distribution is associated with the difference $\hat{p}_{NY} - \hat{p}_{NE}$?
  Justify your answer.
\item Determine the probability that $\hat{p}_{NY} - \hat{p}_{NE}$ will be larger than 0.055.
\item Determine the probability that $\hat{p}_{NY} - \hat{p}_{NE}$ will be smaller than 0.4.
