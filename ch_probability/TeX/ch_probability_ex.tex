\eoce{\qt{True or false} Determine if the statements below are true or false, and explain your reasoning.
\begin{parts}
\item If a fair coin is tossed many times and the last eight tosses are all heads, then the chance that the next toss will be heads is somewhat less than 50\%.
\item Drawing a face card (jack, queen, or king) and drawing a red card from a full deck of playing cards are mutually exclusive events.
\item Drawing a face card and drawing an ace from a full deck of playing cards are mutually exclusive events.

\eoce{\qt{Roulette wheel\label{roulette_wheel}} The game of roulette involves spinning a wheel with 38 slots: 18 red, 18 black, and 2 green. A ball is spun onto the wheel and will eventually land in a slot, where each slot has an equal chance of capturing the ball.

\noindent\begin{minipage}[c]{0.68\textwidth}
\begin{parts}
\item You watch a roulette wheel spin 3 consecutive times and the ball lands on a red slot each time. What is the probability that the ball will land on a red slot on the next spin?
\item You watch a roulette wheel spin 300 consecutive times and the ball lands on a red slot each time. What is the probability that the ball will land on a red slot on the next spin?
\item Are you equally confident of your answers to parts~(a) and~(b)? Why or why not?

\eoce{\qt{Four games, one winner}\ \videohref{ahss_eoce_sol-four_games_one_winner}\ \ Below are four versions of the same game. Your archnemesis gets to pick the version of the game, and then you get to choose how many times to flip a coin: 10 times or 100 times. Identify how many coin flips you should choose for each version of the game. It costs \$1 to play each game. Explain your reasoning.
\begin{parts}
\item If the proportion of heads is larger than 0.60, you win \$1.
\item If the proportion of heads is larger than 0.40, you win \$1.
\item If the proportion of heads is between 0.40 and 0.60, you win \$1.
\item If the proportion of heads is smaller than 0.30, you win \$1.

\eoce{\qt{Backgammon} Backgammon is a board game for two players in which the playing pieces are moved according to the roll of two dice. Players win by removing all of their pieces from the board, so it is usually good to roll high numbers. You are playing backgammon with a friend and you roll two 6s in your first roll and two 6s in your second roll. Your friend rolls two 3s in his first roll and again in his second row. Your friend claims that you are cheating, because rolling double 6s twice in a row is very unlikely. Using probability, show that your rolls were just as likely as his.

The genetic test is 99\% accurate if a person actually has the predisposition, meaning that the probability of a positive test result when a person actually has the predisposition is 0.99.

\eoce{\qt{It's never lupus} \videohref{ahss_eoce_sol-tree_lupus}\ \ Lupus is a medical phenomenon where antibodies that are supposed to attack foreign cells to prevent infections instead see plasma proteins as foreign bodies, leading to a high risk of blood clotting. It is believed that 2\% of the population suffer from this disease. The test is 98\% accurate if a person actually has the disease. The test is 74\% accurate if a person does not have the disease. There is a line from the Fox television show \emph{House} that is often used after a patient tests positive for lupus: ``It's never lupus." Do you think there is truth to this statement?

\eoce{\qt{Exploring permutations} The formula for the number of ways to arrange $n$ objects is $n! = n\times(n-1)\times \cdots \times 2 \times 1$. This exercise walks you through the derivation of this formula for a couple of special cases.

That is, all possible orderings of the cars in the row of spots are equally likely.
\begin{parts}

\eoce{\qt{Male children} While it is often assumed that the probabilities of having a boy or a girl are the same, the actual probability of having a boy is slightly higher at 0.51. Suppose a couple plans to have 3 kids.

\item Write out all possible orderings of 3 children, 2 of whom are boys. Use these scenarios to calculate the same probability from part (a) but using the Addition Rule for disjoint events. Confirm that your answers from parts (a) and (b) match.
\item If we wanted to calculate the probability that a couple who plans to have 8 kids will have 3 boys, briefly describe why the approach from part (b) would be more tedious than the approach from part (a).

\eoce{\qt{Smog check, Part I} \label{smogCheck} Suppose 16\% of cars fail pollution tests (smog checks) in California. We would like to estimate the probability that an entire fleet of seven cars would pass using a simulation. We assume each car is independent. We only want to know if the entire fleet passed, i.e. none of the cars failed. What is wrong with each of the following simulations to represent whether an entire (simulated) fleet passed?
\begin{parts}
\item Flip a coin seven times where each toss represents a car. A head means the car passed and a tail means it failed. If all cars passed, we report PASS for the fleet. If at least one car failed, we report FAIL.
\item Read across a random number table starting at line 5. If a number is a 0 or 1, let it represent a failed car. Otherwise the car passes. We report PASS if all cars passed and FAIL otherwise.
\item Read across a random number table, looking at two digits for each simulated car. If a pair is in the range [00-16], then the corresponding car failed. If it is in [17-99], the car passed. We report PASS if all cars passed and FAIL otherwise.

\eoce{\qt{To catch a thief} \label{thief} Suppose that at a retail store, $1/5^{th}$ of all employees steal some amount of merchandise. The stores would like to put an end to this practice, and one idea is to use lie detector tests to catch and fire thieves. However, there is a problem: lie detectors are not 100\% accurate. Suppose it is known that a lie detector has a failure rate of 25\%. A thief will slip by the test 25\% of the time and an honest employee will only pass 75\% of the time. 
\begin{parts}
\item Describe how you would simulate whether an employee is honest or is a thief using a random number table. Write your simulation very carefully so someone else can read it and follow the directions exactly.
\item Using a random number table, simulate 20 employees working at this store and determine if they are honest or not. Make sure to record the random digits assigned to each employee as you will refer back to these in part (c).
\item Determine the result of the lie detector test for each simulated employee  from part (b) using a new simulation scheme.
\item How many of these employees are ``honest and passed" and how many are ``honest and failed"?
\item How many of these employees are ``thief and passed" and how many are ``thief and failed"?
\item Suppose the management decided to fire everyone who failed the lie detector test. What percent of fired employees were honest? What percent of not fired employees were thieves?
