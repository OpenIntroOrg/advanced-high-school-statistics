% 7 - tf_prob_definitions

\eoce{\qt{True or false\label{tf_prob_definitions}} Determine if the statements 
below are true or false, and explain your reasoning.
\begin{parts}
\item If a fair coin is tossed many times and the last eight tosses are all heads, 
then the chance that the next toss will be heads is somewhat less than 50\%.
\item Drawing a face card (jack, queen, or king) and drawing a red card from a 
full deck of playing cards are mutually exclusive events.
\item Drawing a face card and drawing an ace from a full deck of playing cards 
are mutually exclusive events.

% 8 - roulette_wheel

\eoce{\qt{Roulette wheel\label{roulette_wheel}} The game of roulette involves 
spinning a wheel with 38 slots: 18 red, 18 black, and 2 green. A ball is spun 
onto the wheel and will eventually land in a slot, where each slot has an equal 
chance of capturing the ball.

\begin{minipage}[c]{0.65\textwidth}
\raggedright\begin{parts}
\item You watch a roulette wheel spin 3 consecutive times and the ball lands on a 
red slot each time. What is the probability that the ball will land on a red slot 
on the next spin?
\item You watch a roulette wheel spin 300 consecutive times and the ball lands on 
a red slot each time. What is the probability that the ball will land on a red 
slot on the next spin?
\item Are you equally confident of your answers to parts~(a) and~(b)? Why or why 
not?

% 9 - four_games_one_winner

\eoce{\qt{Four games, one winner\label{four_games_one_winner}} \videosolution{ahss_eoce_sol-global_warming} Below are four 
versions of the same game. Your archnemesis gets to pick the version of the game, 
and then you get to choose how many times to flip a coin: 10 times or 100 times. 
Identify how many coin flips you should choose for each version of the game. It 
costs \$1 to play each game. Explain your reasoning.
\begin{parts}
\item If the proportion of heads is larger than 0.60, you win \$1.
\item If the proportion of heads is larger than 0.40, you win \$1.
\item If the proportion of heads is between 0.40 and 0.60, you win \$1.
\item If the proportion of heads is smaller than 0.30, you win \$1.

% 10 - backgammon

\eoce{\qt{Backgammon\label{backgammon}} Backgammon is a board game for two 
players in which the playing pieces are moved according to the roll of two dice. 
Players win by removing all of their pieces from the board, so it is usually good 
to roll high numbers. You are playing backgammon with a friend and you roll two 
6s in your first roll and two 6s in your second roll. Your friend rolls two 3s in 
his first roll and again in his second row. Your friend claims that you are 
cheating, because rolling double 6s twice in a row is very unlikely. Using 
probability, show that your rolls were just as likely as~his.
