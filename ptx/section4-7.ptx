        <p>
          The game of roulette involves spinning a wheel with 38 slots: 18 red, 18 black,
          and 2 green.
          A ball is spun onto the wheel and will eventually land in a slot,
          where each slot has an equal chance of capturing the ball.

      <title>Backgammon</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Backgammon is a board game for two players in which the playing pieces are moved according to the roll of two dice.
          Players win by removing all of their pieces from the board,
          so it is usually good to roll high numbers.
          You are playing backgammon with a friend and you roll two 6s in your first roll and two 6s in your second roll.
          Your friend rolls two 3s in his first roll and again in his second row.
          Your friend claims that you are cheating,
          because rolling double 6s twice in a row is very unlikely.
          Using probability, show that your rolls were just as likely as his.

      <title>Assortative mating</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Assortative mating is a nonrandom mating pattern where individuals with similar genotypes and/or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than what would be expected under a random mating pattern.
          Researchers studying this topic collected data on eye colors of 204 Scandinavian men and their female partners.
          The table below summarizes the results.
          For simplicity,

          A genetic test is used to determine if people have a predisposition for <em>thrombosis</em>,
          which is the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel that obstructs the flow of blood through the circulatory system.
          It is believed that 3% of people actually have this predisposition.
          The genetic test is 99% accurate if a person actually has the predisposition,
          meaning that the probability of a positive test result when a person actually has the predisposition is 0.99.
          The test is 98% accurate if a person does not have the predisposition.
          What is the probability that a randomly selected person who tests positive for the predisposition by the test actually has the predisposition?

        <p>
          MISSINGVIDEOLINK<nbsp/> Lupus is a medical phenomenon where antibodies that are supposed to attack foreign cells to prevent infections instead see plasma proteins as foreign bodies,
          leading to a high risk of blood clotting.
          It is believed that 2% of the population suffer from this disease.
          The test is 98% accurate if a person actually has the disease.
          The test is 74% accurate if a person does not have the disease.
          There is a line from the Fox television show <em>House</em>
          that is often used after a patient tests positive for lupus: ``It's never lupus." Do you think there is truth to this statement?

          If he gets a number card (2-10), he wins nothing.
          For any face card (jack, queen or king), he wins $3.

          A ball is spun onto the wheel and will eventually land in a slot,
