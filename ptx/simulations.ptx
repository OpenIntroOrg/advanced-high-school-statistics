      What is the probability of getting a sum greater than 16 in three rolls of a die?
      Finding all possible combinations that satisfy this would be tedious,
      but we could conduct a physical simulation or a computer simulation to estimate this probability.
      With modern computing power,
      simulations have become an important and powerful tool for data scientists.
      In this section,
      we will look at the concepts that underlie simulations.

    <title>Setting up and carrying out simulations</title>
    <p>
      In the previous section we saw how to apply the binomial formula to find the probability of exactly <m>x</m> successes in <m>n</m> independent trials when a success has probability <m>p</m>.
      Sometimes we have a problem we want to solve but we don't know the appropriate formula,
      or even worse, a formula may not exist.
      In this case,
      one common approach is to estimate the probability using <em>simulations</em>.
          <idx><h>simulation|textbf</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      You may already be familiar with simulations.
      Want to know the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with a pair of dice?
      Roll a pair of dice many, many,
      many times and see what proportion of times the sum is 7.
      The more times you roll the pair of dice,
      the better the estimate will tend to be.
      Of course, such experiments can be time consuming or even infeasible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we consider simulations using
      <term>random numbers</term>.
      Random numbers
      (or technically,
      <em>psuedo-random numbers</em><idx><h>random numbers</h><h>psuedo-random numbers</h></idx>)
      can be produced using a calculator or computer.
      Random digits are produced such that each digit,
      <em>0-9</em>, is equally likely to come up in each spot.
      You'll find that occasionally we may have the same number in a row <mdash/> sometimes multiple times <mdash/> but in the long run,
      each digit should appear 1/10th of the time.

          In the previous example,
          the probability that a box of cereal contains a prize is 20%. The question presented is equivalent to asking,
          what is the probability of getting at least one prize in six randomly selected boxes of cereal.
          This probability question can be solved explicitly using the method of complements.
          Find this probability.
          How does the estimate arrived at by simulation compare to this probability?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      We can also use simulations to estimate quantities other than probabilities.
      Consider the following example.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's say that instead of buying exactly 6 boxes of cereal, Mika's mother agrees to buy boxes of this cereal <em>until</em>
          she finds one with a prize.
          On average, how many boxes of cereal would one have to buy until one gets a prize?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          For this question, we can use the same digit assignment.
          However, our stopping rule is different.
          Each trial may require a different number of digits.
          For each trial, the stopping rule is:
          look at digits until we encounter a
          <em>0</em> or a <em>1</em>.
          Then, record how many digits/boxes of cereal it took.
          Repeat the simulation for 20 trials,
          and then average the numbers from each trial.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's begin again at row 1.
          We can read across or down, depending upon what is most convenient.
          Since there are 20 columns and we want 20 trials,
          we will read down the columns.
          Starting at column 1, we count how many digits
          (boxes of cereal)
          we encounter until we reach a <em>0</em> or <em>1</em>
          (which represent a prize).
          For trial 1 we see <em>461</em>, so we record 3.
          For trial 2 we see <em>3395641</em>, so we record 7.
          For trial 3, we see <em>0</em>, so we record 1.
          The rest of this exercise is left as a Guided Practice problem for you to complete.

      Does anyone perform simulations like this?
      Sort of.
      Simulations are used a lot in statistics,
      and these often require the same principles covered in this section to properly set up those simulations.
      The difference is in implementation after the setup.
      Rather than use a random number table,
      a data scientist will write a program that uses a pseudo-random number generator in a computer to run the simulations very quickly <mdash/> often times millions of trials each second,
      which provides much more accurate estimates than running a couple dozen trials by hand.

          The first step to setting up a simulation is to assign digits to represent outcomes.
          This should be done in such a way as to give the event of interest the correct probability.
          Then, using a random number table, calculator,
          or computer, generate random digits
          (outcomes).
          Repeat this a specified number of trials or until a given stopping rule.
          When this is finished,
          count up how many times the event happened and divide that by the number of trials to get the estimate of the probability.

          Suppose 16% of cars fail pollution tests

          in California.
          We would like to estimate the probability that an entire fleet of seven cars would pass using a simulation.

      <title>To catch a thief</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that at a retail store,
          <m>1/5^{th}</m> of all employees steal some amount of merchandise.
          The stores would like to put an end to this practice,
          and one idea is to use lie detector tests to catch and fire thieves.
          However, there is a problem:
          lie detectors are not 100% accurate.
          Suppose it is known that a lie detector has a failure rate of 25%. A thief will slip by the test 25% of the time and an honest employee will only pass 75% of the time.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Describe how you would simulate whether an employee is honest or is a thief using a random number table.
                Write your simulation very carefully so someone else can read it and follow the directions exactly.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Using a random number table,
                simulate 20 employees working at this store and determine if they are honest or not.
                Make sure to record the random digits assigned to each employee as you will refer back to these in part (c).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Determine the result of the lie detector test for each simulated employee from part (b) using a new simulation scheme.

                How many of these employees are
                <q>honest and passed</q>
                and how many are
                <q>honest and failed</q>?
              </p>

                How many of these employees are
                <q>thief and passed</q>
                and how many are

                Suppose the management decided to fire everyone who failed the lie detector test.
                What percent of fired employees were honest?
                What percent of not fired employees were thieves?
