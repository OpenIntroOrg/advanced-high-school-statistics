  <title>Summarizing data</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      After collecting data,
      the next stage in the investigative process is to describe and summarize the data.
      In this chapter,
      we will look at ways to summarize numerical and categorical data graphically,
      numerically, and verbally.
      While in practice,
      numerical and graphical summaries are done using computer software,
      it is helpful to understand how these summaries are created and it is especially important to understand how to interpret and communicate these findings.
