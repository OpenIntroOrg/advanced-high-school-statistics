  <title>Inference for categorical data</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter,
      we apply the methods and ideas from <xref ref="ch_foundations_for_inf">Chapter</xref>
      in several contexts for categorical data.
      We'll start by revisiting what we learned for a single proportion,
      where a normal distribution can be used to model the uncertainty in the sample proportion.
      Next, we apply these same ideas to analyze the difference of two proportions using a normal model.
      Later in the chapter we will encounter contingency tables,
      and we will use a different distribution,
      though the core ideas of hypothesis testing remain the same.
