        <p>
          Each year, the US Census Bureau surveys about 3.5 million households with The American Community Survey (ACS).
          Data collected from the ACS have been crucial in government and policy decisions,
          helping to determine the allocation of federal and state funds each year.
          Some of the questions asked on the survey are about their income, age
          (in years),
          and gender.
          The table below contains this information for a random sample of 20 respondents to the 2012 ACS. \footfullcite{data:acs:2012}

      <statement>
        <p>
          A baseball team's success in a season is usually measured by their number of wins.
          In order to win,
          the team has to have scored more points (runs) than their opponent in any given game.
          As such, number of runs is often a good proxy for the success of the team.
          The table below shows number of runs, home runs,
          and batting averages for a random sample of 10 teams in the 2014 Major League Baseball season. \footfullcite{data:MLB:2014}

          A recent article in a college newspaper stated that college students get an average of 5.5 hrs of sleep each night.

          On average, the sampled students slept 6.25 hours per night.

                American households spent an average of about $52 in 2007 on Halloween merchandise such as costumes,
                decorations and candy.
                To see if this number had changed,
                researchers conducted a new survey in 2008 before industry numbers were reported.
                The survey included 1,500 households and found that average Halloween spending was $58 per household.

      <title>Days off at a mining plant</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Workers at a particular mining site receive an average of 35 days paid vacation,
          which is lower than the national average.
          The manager of this plant is under pressure from a local union to increase the amount of paid time off.
          However, he does not want to give more days off to the workers because that would be costly.
          Instead he decides he should fire 10 employees in such a way as to raise the average number of days off that are reported by his employees.
          In order to achieve this goal,
          should he fire employees who have the most number of days off,
          least number of days off,
          or those who have about the average number of days off?

          910 randomly sampled registered voters from Tampa, FL were asked if they thought workers who have illegally entered the US should be (i) allowed to keep their jobs and apply for US citizenship, (ii) allowed to keep their jobs as temporary guest workers but not allowed to apply for US citizenship,
          or (iii) lose their jobs and have to leave the country.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Rosiglitazone is the active ingredient in the controversial type<nbsp/>2 diabetes medicine Avandia and has been linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as stroke,
          heart failure,
          and death.
          A common alternative treatment is pioglitazone,
          the active ingredient in a diabetes medicine called Actos.
          In a nationwide retrospective observational study of 227,571 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older,
          it was found that 2,593 of the 67,593 patients using rosiglitazone and 5,386 of the 159,978 using pioglitazone had serious cardiovascular problems.
          These data are summarized in the contingency table below. \footfullcite{Graham:2010}

              Since more patients on pioglitazone had cardiovascular problems (5,386 vs. 2,593), we can conclude that the rate of cardiovascular problems for those on a pioglitazone treatment is higher.

            <li>
              <p>
                The data suggest that diabetic patients who are taking rosiglitazone are more likely to have cardiovascular problems since the rate of incidence was (2,593 / 67,593 = 0.038) 3.8% for patients on this treatment,
                while it was only (5,386 / 159,978 = 0.034) 3.4% for patients on pioglitazone. \textA{<em>(Note that parts<nbsp/>(c) and<nbsp/>(d) for this question are on the next page.)</em>}

            <task>
              Based on the information provided so far, we cannot tell if the difference between the rates of incidences is due to a relationship between the two variables or due to chance.

      <title>Heart transplants</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan.
          Each patient entering the program was designated an official heart transplant candidate,
          meaning that he was gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart.
          Some patients got a transplant and some did not.
          The variable <c>transplant</c> indicates which group the patients were in;
          patients in the treatment group got a transplant and those in the control group did not.
          Another variable called <c>survived</c> was used to indicate whether or not the patient was alive at the end of the study.
          Of the 34 patients in the control group, 4 were alive at the end of the study.
          Of the 69 patients in the treatment group, 24 were alive.
          The contingency table below summarizes these results.\footfullcite{Turnbull+Brown+Hu:1974}

                The paragraph below describes the set up for such approach, if we were to do it without using statistical software. Fill in the blanks with a number or phrase, whichever is appropriate. We write <em>alive</em> on \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} cards representing patients who were alive at the end of the study, and <em>dead</em> on \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} cards representing patients who were not. Then, we shuffle these cards and split them into two groups: one group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing treatment, and another group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing control. We calculate the difference between the proportion of <em>dead</em> cards in the treatment and control groups (treatment - control) and record this value. We repeat this 100 times to build a distribution centered at \rule{2cm}{0.5pt}. Lastly, we calculate the fraction of simulations where the simulated differences in proportions are \rule{2cm}{0.5pt}. If this fraction is low, we conclude that it is unlikely to have observed such an outcome by chance and that the null hypothesis (independence model) should be rejected in favor of the alternative.

              We can investigate the relationship between outcome and treatment in this study using a randomization technique.
              While in reality we would carry out the simulations required for randomization using statistical software,
              suppose we actually simulate using index cards.
              In order to simulate from the independence model,
              which states that the outcomes were independent of the treatment,
              we write whether or not each patient had a cardiovascular problem on cards,
              shuffled all the cards together,
              then deal them into two groups of size 67,593 and 159,978.
              We repeat this simulation 1,000 times and each time record the number of people in the rosiglitazone group who had cardiovascular problems.

        <p>
          Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment compared to symptomatic treatment for acute sinusitis randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with sinusitis into two groups
          (as discussed in <xref ref="sinusitis">Exercise</xref>).
          Participants in the antibiotic group received a 10-day course of an antibiotic,
          and the rest received symptomatic treatments as a placebo.
          These pills had the same taste and packaging as the antibiotic.
          At the end of the 10-day period patients were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms since the beginning of the study.
          The distribution of responses is summarized below. \footfullcite{Garbutt:2012}

              Write out these competing claims in easy-to-understand language and in the context of the application.

              Based on your finding in (c),
              does the evidence favor the alternative model?
              If not, then explain why.
              If so, what would you do to check if whether this is strong evidence?
