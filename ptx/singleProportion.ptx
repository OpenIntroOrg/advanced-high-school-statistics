      In this section,
      we will apply the inferential procedures introduced in <xref ref="ch_foundations_for_inf">Chapter</xref>
      to the context of a single proportion,
      and we will explore how to do sample<nbsp/>size calculations for data collection purposes.
      We will answer questions such as the following:

    <title>Distribution of a sample proportion (review)</title>
    <p>
      The distribution of a sample proportion,
      such as the distribution of all possible values for the proportion of people who share a particular opinion in a poll,
      was introduced in <xref ref="distributionphat">Section</xref>.
      When the sampling distribution of a sample proportion,
      <m>\hat{p}</m>, is approximately normal,
      we can use confidence intervals and hypothesis tests based on a normal distribution.
      We call these Z-intervals and Z-tests for short.
      Here, we review the conditions necessary for a sample proportion to be modeled using a normal distribution.

        {Conditions for the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> being nearly normal} The sampling distribution of a sample proportion,
        <m>\hat{p}</m>,
        based on a random sample of size <m>n</m> from a population with a true proportion <m>p</m>,
        is nearly normal when
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              the sample observations are independent and

      </p>

    <title>Checking conditions for inference using a normal distribution</title>
    <p>
      We can use a normal model for inference for a proportion when the observations are independent and the sampling distribution of the sample proportion is nearly normal.
      We check that these assumptions are reasonable by verifying the following conditions.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <title>Independent.</title>
          <p>
            Observations can be considered independent when the data are collected from a
            <em>random process</em>,
            such as tossing a coin, or from a <em>random sample</em>.
            Without a random sample or process,
            the standard error formula would not apply,
            and it is unclear to what population the inference would apply.
            When sampling without replacement from a finite population,
            the observations can be considered independent when sampling less than 10% of the population.<fn>
            When sampling without replacement and sampling greater than 10% of the population,
            a modified standard error formula should be used.
            </fn>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Nearly normal sampling distribution.</title>
          <p>
            We saw in <xref ref="distributionphat">Section</xref>
            that the sampling distribution of a sample proportion will be nearly normal when the success-failure condition is met,
            i.e. when the expected number of success and failures are both at least 10.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In our examples, we generally sample from large populations,
      such as the United States.
      In these cases,
      we do not explicitly verify that the sample<nbsp/>size is less than 10% of the population size.
      However, in borderline cases,
      one should remember to check this condition as well to ensure that the standard error estimate is reasonable.

    <p>
      The Gallup organization began measuring the public's view of the Supreme Court's job performance in 2000,
      and has measured it every year since then with the question: ``Do you approve or disapprove of the way the Supreme Court is handling its job?". In 2018,
      the Gallup poll randomly sampled 1,033 adults in the U.S. and found that 53% of them approved.<fn>
      MISSINGoiRedirect
      </fn> We know that 53% is just a point estimate.
      What range of values are reasonable estimates for the percent of the population that approved of the job the Supreme Court is doing?
      We can use the confidence interval procedure introduced in the previous chapter to answer this question,
      but first we must clearly identify the parameter we're trying to estimate and be sure that a Z-interval will be appropriate.
      The following examples walk through the various steps for carrying out a confidence interval procedure using the Gallup poll data.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Identify the population of interest and the parameter of interest for the Gallup poll about the U.S. Supreme Court.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Identify the population of interest and the parameter of interest for the Gallup poll about the U.S. Supreme Court.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Can the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> be modeled using a normal distribution?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          In order to construct a Z-interval,
          the sample statistic must be able to be modeled using a normal distribution.
          Gallup took a random sample, so the first condition
          (the independence condition)
          is satisfied.
          We must also test the second condition
          (the success-failure condition)
          to ensure that the sample<nbsp/>size is large enough for the central limit theorem to apply.
          The success-failure condition is met when <m>np</m> and <m>n(1-p)</m> are at least 10.
          Since <m>p</m> is always unknown when constructing a confidence interval for <m>p</m>,
          we use the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> to check this condition.
          Here we have:
          <md>
            <mrow>n\hat{p} = 1033(0.53) = 547\text{ (``successes'') }</mrow>
            <mrow>n(1-\hat{p}) = 1033(1 - 0.53) = 486\text{ (``failures'') }</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The second condition is satisfied since 547 and 486 are both at least 10.
          With the two conditions satisfied,
          we can model the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> using a normal model and we can construct a Z-interval.

    </p>
    <p>
      Planning a sample<nbsp/>size before collecting data is important.
      If we collect too little data,
      the standard error of our point estimate may be so large that the estimate is not very useful.
      On the other hand,
      collecting data in some contexts is time-consuming and expensive,
      so we don't want to waste resources on collecting more data than we need.
    </p>
    <p>
      When considering the sample<nbsp/>size,
      we want to put an upper bound on the margin of error.
      Recall that the <term>margin of error</term>
      is measured as the distance between the point estimate and the lower or upper bound of a confidence interval.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title></title>
      <p>
        The margin of error of a confidence interval is given by:
        <md>
          <mrow>\text{ critical value }  \ \times SE \text{ of estimate }</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        The margin of error tells us with a given confidence level how far off we expect our point estimate to be from the true value.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we are conducting a university survey to determine whether students support a $200 per year increase in fees to pay for a new football stadium.
          Find the smallest sample<nbsp/>size <m>n</m> so that the margin of error of the point estimate <m>\hat{p}</m> will be no larger than 0.04 when using a 95% confidence level.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Because we are working with proportions,
          the critical value is a <m>z^{\star}</m> value.
          We want the margin of error to be less than or equal to 0.04, so we have:
          <md>
            <mrow>z^{\star}\times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \leq 0.04</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two unknowns in the inequality:
          <m>p</m> and <m>n</m>.
          If we have an estimate of <m>p</m>,
          perhaps from a similar survey, we could use that value.
          If we have no such estimate, we must use some other value for <m>p</m>.
          It turns out that the margin of error is largest when <m>p</m> is 0.5, so we typically use this
          <em>worst case estimate</em>
          of <m>p</m> = 0.5 if no other estimate is available.
          <md>
            <mrow>1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{n}} \amp \leq 0.04</mrow>

            <mrow>n=601</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The sample<nbsp/>size must be an integer and we round up because <m>n</m> must be greater than or equal to 600.25.
          We need at least 601 participants to ensure the sample proportion is within 0.04 of the true proportion with 95% confidence.
        </p>
      </answer>
    </example>
    <p>
      No estimate of the true proportion is required in sample<nbsp/>size computations for a proportion.
      However, if we have a reliable estimate of the proportion,
      we should use it in place of the worst case estimate of<nbsp/>0.5.

    <title>Hypothesis testing for a proportion</title>
    <p>
      While a confidence interval provides a range of reasonable values for an unknown parameter,
      a hypothesis test evaluates a specific claim.
      In a hypothesis test,
      we set up competing hypotheses and find degrees of evidence against the null hypothesis.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Deborah Toohey is running for Congress,
          and her campaign manager claims she has more than 50% support from the district's electorate.
          A newspaper collects a random sample of 500 likely voters in the district and estimates Toohey's support to be 52%.

                Can we model <m>\hat{p}</m> using a normal model?

            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          (a) The alternative hypothesis,
          the one that bears the burden of proof,
          argues that Toohey has more than 50% support.
          Therefore, <m>H_A</m> will be one-sided and the null value will be <m>p_0 = 0.5</m>.
          So we have <m>H_0</m>: <m>p = 0.5</m> and <m>H_A</m>: <m>p > 0.5</m>.
          Note that the hypotheses are about a population parameter.
          The hypotheses are never about the sample.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) First, we observe that the problem states that a random sample was chosen.
          Next, we check the success-failure condition.
          Because we assume that <m>p = p_0</m> for the calculations of the hypothesis test,
          we use the hypothesized value <m>p_0</m> rather than the sample value <m>\hat{p}</m> when verifying the success-failure condition.

          The conditions for a normal model are met.

      </answer>
    </example>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="foundationsForInference">Chapter</xref>,
      we saw that the general form of the test statistic for a hypothesis test takes the following form:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ test statistic }  = \frac{\text{ point estimate }  - \text{ null value } }{SE \text{ of estimate } }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the conditions for a normal model are met:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            We use Z as the test statistic and call the test a Z-test.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The point estimate is the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m>
            (just like for a confidence interval).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since we compute the test statistic assuming the null hypothesis
            (that <m>p = p_0</m>)
            is true, we compute the standard error of the sample proportion using the null value <m>p_0</m>.

          A Gallup poll conducted in March of 2016 found that 54% of respondents oppose nuclear energy.
          This was the first time since Gallup first asked the question in 1994 that a majority of respondents said they oppose nuclear energy.
          The survey was based on telephone interviews from a random sample of 1,019 adults in the United States.
          Does this poll provide evidence that greater than half of U.S. adults oppose nuclear energy?
          Carry out an appropriate test at the 0.10 significance level.

    <title>Section summary</title>
    <p>
      Most of the confidence interval procedures and hypothesis tests of this book involve:
      a <term>point estimate</term>,
      the <term>standard error</term> of the point estimate,
      and an assumption about the <term>shape of the sampling distribution</term> of the point estimate.
      In this section,
      we explore inference when the parameter of interest is a <em>proportion</em>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          We use the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> as the <em>point estimate</em>
          for the unknown population proportion <m>p</m>.
          The sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> is approximately normal when the success-failure condition is met and the observations are independent.
          The observations can generally be considered independent when the data is collected from a random sample or come from a stable,
          random process analogous to flipping a coin.
          When the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> is normal,
          the standardized test statistic also follows a
          <term>normal</term> distribution.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              use the <em>sample</em> proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> for the confidence interval, but
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              use the <em>null/hypothesized</em>
              proportion <m>p_0</m> for the hypothesis test.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When there is one sample and the parameter of interest is a single proportion:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Estimate <m>p</m> at the C% confidence level using a
                <term>1-proportion Z-interval</term>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Test <m>H_0</m>:
                <m>p=p_0</m> at the <m>\alpha</m> significance level using a
                <term>1-proportion Z-test</term>.

          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The first condition for the one proportion Z-interval and Z-test is the same.
          The second one is different because of the use of the null proportion for the test.
