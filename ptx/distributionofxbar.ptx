  <title>Sampling distribution of a sample mean</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      If bags of chips are produced with an average weight of 15<nbsp/>oz and a standard deviation of 0.1<nbsp/>oz,
      what is the probability that the average weight of 30 bags will be within 0.1<nbsp/>oz of the mean?
      The answer is not 68%! To answer this question we must visualize and understand what is called the
      <em>sampling distribution</em> of a sample mean.

        The sampling distribution represents the distribution of the point estimates based on samples of a fixed size from a certain population.
        It is useful to think of a point estimate as being drawn from such a distribution.
        Understanding the concept of a sampling distribution is central to understanding statistical inference.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      The sampling distribution shown in <xref ref="netTime1000SamplingDistribution">Figure</xref>
      is unimodal and approximately symmetric.
      It is also centered exactly at the true population mean:
      <m>\mu=94.52</m>.
      Intuitively, this makes sense.
      The sample mean should be an unbiased estimator of the population mean.
      Because we are considering the distribution of the sample mean,
      we will use <m>\mu_{\bar{x}} = 94.52</m> to describe the true mean of this distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can see that the sample mean has some variability around the population mean,
      which can be quantified using the standard deviation of this distribution of sample means.
      The standard deviation of the sample mean tells us how far the typical estimate is away from the actual population mean, 94.52 minutes.
      It also describes the typical <term>error</term> of a single estimate,
      and is denoted by the symbol <m>\sigma_{\bar{x}}</m>.

        The standard deviation associated with an estimate describes the typical error or uncertainty associated with the estimate.

          Looking at <xref ref="run17sampHistograms">Figures</xref>
          and <xref ref="netTime1000SamplingDistribution"></xref>,
          we see that the standard deviation of the sample mean with <m>n=100</m> is much smaller than the standard deviation of a single sample.
          Interpret this statement and explain why it is true.

      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The variation from one sample mean to another sample mean is much smaller than the variation from one individual to another individual.
          This makes sense because when we average over 100 values,
          the large and small values tend to cancel each other out.
          While many individuals have a time under 90 minutes,
          it would be unlikely for the <em>average</em>
          of 100 runners to be less than 90 minutes.

          (a) Would you rather use a small sample or a large sample when estimating a parameter?
          Why? (b) Using your reasoning from (a),
          would you expect a point estimate based on a small sample to have smaller or larger standard deviation than a point estimate based on a larger sample?

      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      When considering how to calculate the standard deviation of a sample mean,
      there is one problem:
      there is no obvious way to estimate this from a single sample.
      However, statistical theory provides a helpful tool to address this issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sample of 100 runners,
      the standard deviation of the sample mean is equal to one-tenth of the population standard deviation:
      <m>15.93/10 = 1.59</m>.
      In other words,
      the standard deviation of the sample mean based on 100 observations is equal to
      <md>
        <mrow>SD_{\bar{x}} = \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma_{x}}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{15.93}{\sqrt{100}} = 1.59</mrow>
      </md>
      where <m>\sigma_{x}</m> is the standard deviation of the individual observations.
      This is no coincidence.
      We can show mathematically that this equation is correct when the observations are independent using the probability tools of <xref ref="randomVariablesSection">Section</xref>.

    <p>
      In <xref ref="netTime1000SamplingDistribution">Figure</xref>,
      the sampling distribution of the sample mean looks approximately normally distributed.
      Will the sampling distribution of a mean always be nearly normal?
      To address this question,
      we will investigate three cases to see roughly when the approximation is reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      We consider three data sets:
      one from a <em>uniform</em> distribution,
      one from an <em>exponential</em> distribution,
      and the other from a <em>normal</em> distribution.
      These distributions are shown in the top panels of <xref ref="cltSimulations">Figure</xref>.
      The uniform distribution is symmetric,
      and the exponential distribution may be considered as having moderate skew since its right tail is relatively short
      (few outliers).

      The left panel in the <m>n=2</m> row represents the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> if it is the sample mean of two observations from the uniform distribution shown.
      The dashed line represents the closest approximation of the normal distribution.
      Similarly, the center and right panels of the <m>n=2</m> row represent the respective distributions of <m>\bar{x}</m> for data from exponential and log-normal distributions.

          Examine the distributions in each row of <xref ref="cltSimulations">Figure</xref>.
          What do you notice about the sampling distribution of the mean as the sample size,
          <m>n</m>,
          becomes larger?

    </exercise>
    <example>
      <statement>

          In general, would normal approximation for a sample mean be appropriate when the sample size is at least 30?

        If the population is normal,
        the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> will be normal for any sample size.
      </p>
      <p>
        The less normal the population,
        the larger <m>n</m> needs to be for the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> to be nearly normal.
        However, a good rule of thumb is that for almost all populations,
        the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> will be approximately normal if <m>n \ge 30</m>.

      <p>
        When taking a random sample of independent observations from a population with a fixed mean and standard deviation,

          Sometimes we do not know what the population distribution looks like.
          We have to infer it based on the distribution of a single sample.

          can the normal approximation be applied to the distribution of the sample mean?

                There are two outliers in the data, both quite extreme,
                which suggests the population may not be normal and instead may be very strongly skewed or have distant outliers.
                Outliers can play an important role and affect the distribution of the sample mean and the estimate of the standard deviation of the sample mean.

          Since we should be skeptical of the independence of observations and the extreme upper outliers pose a challenge,
          we should not use the normal model for the sample mean of these 20 observations.
          If we can obtain a much larger sample,
          then the concerns about skew and outliers would no longer apply.

    <title>Normal approximation for the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m></title>
    <p>
      At the beginning of this chapter,
      we used normal approximation for populations or for data that had an approximately normal distribution.
      When appropriate conditions are met,
      we can also use the normal approximation to estimate probabilities about a sample average.
      We must remember to verify that the conditions are met and use the mean
      <m>\mu_{\bar{x}}</m> and standard deviation
      <m>\sigma_{\bar{x}}</m> for the sampling distribution of the sample average.

          John is shopping for wireless routers and is overwhelmed by the number of available options.
          In order to get a feel for the average price,
          he takes a random sample of 75 routers and finds that the average price for this sample is $75 and the standard deviation is $25.

              <p>
                Based on this information,
                how much variability should he expect to see in the mean prices of repeated samples,
                each containing 75 randomly selected wireless routers?
