      Often times we wish to compare two groups to each other to answer questions such as the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Does treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart function following a heart attack?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is there convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a different average birth weight than newborns from mothers who don't smoke?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is there statistically significant evidence that one variation of an exam is harder than another variation?
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Are faculty willing to pay someone named

            more than someone named

    <title>Sampling distribution for the difference of two means</title>
    <p>
      Previously we explored the sampling distribution for the difference of two proportions.
      Here we consider the sampling distribution for the difference of two means.
      We are interested in the distribution of <m>\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2</m>.
      We know that it is centered on <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m>.
      The standard deviation for the difference can be found as follows.
      <md>
        <mrow>SD_{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}} \amp = \sqrt{\left(SD_{\bar{x}_{1}}\right)^2 +\left(SD_{\bar{x}_{2}}\right)^2 }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_{1}}{\sqrt{n_1}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sigma_{2}}{\sqrt{n_2}}\right)^2 }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{n_{1}} + \frac{\sigma_{2}^2}{n_{2}}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we are interested in the shape of the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2</m>.
      It will be nearly normal when the sampling distribution of each of
      <m>\bar{x}_1</m> and <m>\bar{x}_2</m> are nearly normal.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Checking conditions for inference on a difference of means</title>
    <p>
      When comparing two means,
      we carry out inference on a difference of means, <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m>.
      We will use the <m>t</m>-distribution just as we did when carrying out inference on a single mean.
      The assumptions are that the observations are independent,
      both between groups and within groups and that the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2</m> is nearly normal.
      We check whether these assumptions are reasonable by verifying the following conditions.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <title>Independent.</title>
          <p>
            Observations can be considered independent when the data are collected from two independent random samples or,
            in the context of experiments,
            from two randomly assigned treatments.
            Randomly assigning subjects to treatments is equivalent to randomly assigning treatments to subjects.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Nearly normal sampling distribution.</title>
          <p>
            The sampling distribution of
            <m>\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2</m> will be nearly normal when the sampling distribution of
            <m>\bar{x}_1</m> and of <m>\bar{x}_2</m> are nearly normal,
            that is when both population distributions are nearly normal or both sample sizes are at least 30.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      As before, if the sample sizes are small and the population distributions are not known to be nearly normal,
      we look at the data for excessive skew or outliers.
      If we do no find excessive skew or outliers in either group,
      we consider the assumption that the populations are nearly normal to be reasonable.

    <title>Confidence intervals for a difference of means</title>
    <p>
      What's in a name?
      Are employers more likely to offer interviews or higher pay to prospective employees when the name on a resume suggests the candidate is a man versus a woman?
      This is a challenging question to tackle,
      because employers are influenced by many aspects of a resume.
      Thinking back to Chapter 1 on data collection,
      we could imagine a host of confounding factors associated with name and gender.
      How could we possibly isolate just the factor of name?
      We would need an experiment in which name was the only variable and everything else was held constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Researchers at Yale carried out precisely this experiment.
      Their results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).<fn>
      MISSINGoiRedirect
      </fn> The researchers sent out resumes to faculty at academic institutions for a lab manager position.
      The resumes were identical,
      except that on half of them the applicant's name was John and on the other half,
      the applicant's name was Jennifer.
      They wanted to see if faculty,
      specifically faculty trained in conducting scientifically objective research,
      held implicit gender biases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike in the matched pairs scenario,
      each faculty member received only one resume.
      We are interested in comparing the mean salary offered to John relative to the mean salary offered to Jennifer.
      Instead of taking the average of a set of paired differences,
      we find the average of each group separately and take their difference.
      Let
      <md>

        <mrow>\bar{x}_2: \amp \text{ mean salary offered to Jennifer }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will use <m>\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2</m> as our point estimate for <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m>.
      The data is given in the table below.

          Interpret the point estimate 3730.

      <solution>
        <p>
          Interpret the point estimate 3730.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate and interpret the <m>SE</m> for the difference of sample means.

      <solution>
        <p>
          Calculate and interpret the <m>SE</m> for the difference of sample means.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      We see that the difference of sample means of $3,730 is more than 3 <m>SE</m> above 0, which makes us think that the difference being 0 is unreasonable.
      We would like to construct a 95% confidence interval for the theoretical difference in mean salary that would be offered to John versus Jennifer.
      For this, we need the degrees of freedom associated with a two-sample <m>t</m>-interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the one-sample <m>t</m>-procedure,
      the degrees of freedom is given by the simple expression <m>n-1</m>,
      where <m>n</m> is the sample size.
      For the two-sample <m>t</m>-procedures, however,
      there is a complex formula for calculating the degrees of freedom,
      which is based on the two sample sizes and the two sample standard deviations.
      In practice,
      we find the degrees of freedom using software or a calculator
      (see <xref ref="x2SampTint">Section</xref>).
      If this is not possible,
      the alternative is to use the smaller of <m>n_1-1</m> and <m>n_2-1</m>.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title></title>
      <p>
        Use statistical software or a calculator to compute the degrees of freedom for two-sample \mbox{<m>t</m>-procedures} . If this is not possible,
        use the smaller of <m>n_1-1</m> and <m>n_2-1</m>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Verify that conditions are met for a two-sample <m>t</m>-test.
          Then, construct the 95% confidence interval for the difference of means.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Verify that conditions are met for a two-sample <m>t</m>-test.
          Then, construct the 95% confidence interval for the difference of means.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Based on this interval,
      we are 95% confident that the true difference in mean salary that these faculty would offer John versus Jennifer is between $1,495 and $6,055.
      That is, we are 95% confident that the mean salary these faculty would offer John for a lab manager position is between $1,446 and $6,014 <em>more</em>
      than the mean salary they would offer Jennifer for the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results of these studies and others like it are alarming and disturbing.<fn>
      A similar study sent out identical resumes with different names to investigate the importance of perceived race.
      Resumes with a name commonly perceived to be for a White person (e.g.
      Emily) were 50% more likely to receive a callback than the same resume with a name commonly perceived to be for a Black person (e.g.
      Lakisha).
      MISSINGoiRedirect
      </fn> One aspect that makes this bias so difficult to address is that the experiment,
      as well-designed as it was,
      cannot send us much signal about <em>which</em>
      faculty are discriminating.
      Each faculty member received only one of the resumes.
      A faculty member that offered
      <q>Jennifer</q>
      a very low salary may have also offered
      <q>John</q>
      a very low salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      We might imagine an experiment in which each faculty received both resumes,
      so that we could compare how much they would offer a Jennifer versus a John.
      However, the matched pairs scenario is clearly not possible in this case,
      because what makes the experiment work is that the resumes are
      <em>exactly the same</em> except for the name.
      An employer would notice something fishy if they received two identical resumes.
      It is only possible to say that overall,
      the faculty were willing to offer John more money for the lab manager position than Jennifer.
      Finding proof of bias for individual cases is a persistent challenge in enforcing anti-discrimination laws.

              The parameter we want to estimate is <m>\mu_{1}-\mu_2</m>,
              which is the true average score under Version A <m>-</m> the true average score under Version B. We will estimate this parameter at the 95% confidence level.

              Because we are comparing two means,
              we will use a 2-sample <m>t</m>-interval.

            <p>
              The data was collected from an experiment with two randomly assigned treatments, Version A and Version B of test.
              Both groups sizes are 30, so the condition that they are at least 30 is met.

            <p>
              We will calculate the confidence interval as follows.
              <md>
                <mrow>\text{ point estimate } \ \pm\ t^{\star} \times SE\ \text{ of estimate }</mrow>
              </md>
              The point estimate is the difference of sample means:
              <m>\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2 = 79.4 - 74.1 = 5.3</m>    The <m>SE</m> of a difference of sample means is:
              <m>\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{14^2}{30} + \frac{20^2}{30}} = 4.46</m>   In order to find the critical value <m>t^{\star}</m>,
              we must first find the degrees of freedom.
              Using a calculator, we find <m>df=51.9</m>.
              We round down to 50, and using a <m>t</m>-table at row <m>df = 50</m> and confidence level 95%, we get <m>t^{\star} = 2.009</m>.
              The 95% confidence interval is given by:
              <md>
                <mrow>(79.4 - 74.1) \ \pm\  \amp 2.009\times \sqrt{\frac{14^2}{30} + \frac{20^2}{30}}   \qquad df = 45.97</mrow>
                <mrow>5.3 \ \pm\  \amp 2.009\times 4.46</mrow>
                <mrow>=(-3\amp .66,\ 14.26)</mrow>
              </md>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>\inferencestep{Conclude}</title>
            <p>
              We are 95% confident that the true difference in average score between Version A and Version B is between -2.5 and 13.1 points.
              Because the interval contains both positive and negative values,
              the data do not convincingly show that one exam version is more difficult than the other,
              and the teacher should not be convinced that she should add points to the Version B exam scores.

      Four cases from a data set called <c>ncbirths</c>,

      We are particularly interested in two variables: <c>weight</c> and <c>smoke</c>.
      The <c>weight</c> variable represents the weights of the newborns and the <c>smoke</c> variable describes which mothers smoked during pregnancy.
      We would like to know,
      is there convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a different average birth weight than newborns from mothers who don't smoke?
      The smoking group includes a random sample of 50 cases and the nonsmoking group contains a random sample of 100 cases,
      represented in <xref ref="babySmokePlotOfTwoGroupsToExamineSkew">Figure</xref>.

      We check the two conditions necessary to use the <m>t</m>-distribution to the difference in sample means. (1)<nbsp/>Because the data come from a sample,
      we need there to be two independent random samples.
      In fact, there was only one random sample,
      but it is reasonable that the two groups here are independent of each other,
      so we will consider the assumption of independence reasonable. (2)<nbsp/>The sample sizes of 50 and 100 are well over 30,
      so we do not worry about the distributions of the original populations.
      Since both conditions are satisfied,
      the difference in sample means may be modeled using a <m>t</m>-distribution.

          Not necessarily.
          It is possible that there is some difference but that we did not detect it.
          The result must be considered in light of other evidence and research.
          In fact, larger data sets do tend to show that women who smoke during pregnancy have smaller newborns.

          A positive value generally corresponds to increased pumping capacity,

              The point estimate is the difference of sample means:
              <m>\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}=3.50 - (-4.33) = 7.83</m>    The <m>SE</m> of a difference of sample means:

                <mrow>T = \frac{3.50 - (-4.33) - 0}{\sqrt{\frac{(5.17)^2}{9} + \frac{(2.76)^2}{9}} } = \frac{7.83 - 0}{1.95} = 4.01</mrow>
              </md>
              Because <m>H_A</m> is an upper tail test ( <m>></m> ), the p-value corresponds to the area to the right of <m>t=4.01</m> with the appropriate degrees of freedom.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          This section introduced inference for a difference of means,
          which is distinct from inference for a mean of differences.
          To calculate a difference of means,
          <m>\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2</m>,
          we first calculate the mean of each group,
          then we take the difference between those two numbers.
          To calculate a mean of difference,
          <m>\bar{x}_{\textit{{diff}}}</m>,
          we first calculate all of the differences,
          then we find the mean of those differences.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Inference for a difference of means is based on the <m>t</m>-distribution.
          The degrees of freedom is complicated to calculate and we rely on a calculator or other software to calculate this.<fn>
          If this is not available, one can use <m>df=min(n_1-1, n_2-1)</m>.
          </fn>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When there are two samples or treatments and the parameter of interest is a difference of means:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Estimate <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m> at the C% confidence level using a
                <term>2-sample t-interval</term>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Test <m>H_0</m>: <m>\mu_1-\mu_2=0</m> (i.e.
                <m>\mu_1=\mu_2</m>) at the <m>\alpha</m> significance level using a
                <term>2-sample t-test</term> .

          The conditions for the two sample <m>t</m>-interval and <m>t</m>-test are the same.

              <p>
                The data come from 2 independent random samples or 2 randomly assigned treatments.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>2.</title>
              <p>
                <m>n_1\ge 30</m> and <m>n_2\ge 30</m> or both population distributions are nearly normal.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
              <p>
                If the sample sizes are less than 30 and it is not known that both population distributions are nearly normal,
                check for excessive skew or outliers in the data.
                If neither exists,
                the condition that both population distributions could be nearly normal is considered reasonable.
              </p>

          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When the conditions are met,
          we calculate the confidence interval and the test statistic as follows.
          <ul>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
              <p>
                Confidence interval:<nbsp/> <m>\text{ point estimate } \ \pm\ t^{\star} \times SE\ \text{ of estimate }</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
              <p>
                Test statistic:
                <m>T = \frac{\text{ point estimate } - \text{ null value } }{SE \text{ of estimate } }</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        Here the point estimate is the difference of sample means:
        <m>\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2</m>.
      </li>
      <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
        <p>
          The <m>SE</m> of estimate is the <m>SE</m> of a difference of sample means:
          <m>\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1}+\frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">

          { <em>In theFriday the 13<m>^{\text{ th } }</m>, Part I </em>}early 1990's, researchers in the UK collected data on traffic flow,

          The histograms below show the distribution of number of cars passing by a specific intersection on Friday the 6<m>^{\text{ th } }</m> and Friday the 13<m>^{\text{ th } }</m> for many such date pairs.
          Also given are some sample statistics,

        <p>
          Prices of diamonds are determined by what is known as the 4 Cs:
          cut, clarity, color, and carat weight.
          The prices of diamonds go up as the carat weight increases,
          but the increase is not smooth.
          For example,
          the difference between the size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye,
          but the price of a 1 carat diamond tends to be much higher than the price of a 0.99 diamond.
          In this question we use two random samples of diamonds, 0.99 carats and 1 carat,
          each sample of size 23, and compare the average prices of the diamonds.
          In order to be able to compare equivalent units,
          we first divide the price for each diamond by 100 times its weight in carats.
          That is, for a 0.99 carat diamond,
          we divide the price by 99.
          For a 1 carat diamond, we divide the price by 100.
          The distributions and some sample statistics are shown below.\footfullcite{ggplot2}

          Conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate if there is a difference between the
          average standardized prices of 0.99 and 1 carat diamonds. Make sure to state
          your hypotheses clearly, check relevant conditions, and interpret your results
          in context of the data.

      <title>Prison isolation experiment, Part I</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh, NC, volunteered for an experiment involving an
          <q>isolation</q>
          experience.
          The goal of the experiment was to find a treatment that reduces subjects' psychopathic deviant T scores.
          This score measures a person's need for control or their rebellion against control,
          and it is part of a commonly used mental health test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test.
          The experiment had three treatment groups:
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute
                <q>therapeutic</q>
                tape advising that professional help is available.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute
                <q>emotionally neutral</q>
                tape on training hunting dogs.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Four hours of sensory restriction but no taped message.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Forty-two subjects were randomly assigned to these treatment groups,
          and an MMPI test was administered before and after the treatment.
          Distributions of the differences between pre and post treatment scores (pre - post) are shown below,
          along with some sample statistics.
          Use this information to independently test the effectiveness of each treatment.
          Make sure to clearly state your hypotheses, check conditions,
          and interpret results in the context of the data.\footfullcite{data:prison}

      We've reviewed a wide set of inference procedures over the last 3 chapters.
      Let's revisit each and discuss the similarities and differences among them.
      The following confidence intervals and tests are structurally the same <mdash/> they all involve inference on a population parameter,
      where that parameter is a proportion,
      a difference of proportions,
      a mean, a mean of differences, or a difference of means.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            1-proportion <m>z</m>-test/interval
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            2-proportion <m>z</m>-test/interval
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            1-sample <m>t</m>-test/interval
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            matched pairs <m>t</m>-test/interval
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            2-sample <m>t</m>-test/interval
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The above inferential procedures all involve a
      <term>point estimate</term>,
      a <term>standard error</term> of the estimate,
      and an assumption about the <term>shape of the sampling distribution</term> of the point estimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      From <xref ref="inferenceForCategoricalData">Chapter</xref>,
      the <m>\chi^2</m> tests and their uses are as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\chi^2</m> goodness of fit - compares a categorical variable to a known/fixed distribution.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\chi^2</m> test of homogeneity - compares a categorical variable across multiple groups.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\chi^2</m> test of independence - looks for association between two categorical variables.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>\chi^2</m> is a measure of <em>overall</em>
      deviation between observed values and expected values.
      These tests stand apart from the others because when using <m>\chi^2</m> there is not a parameter of interest.
      For this reason there are no confidence intervals using <m>\chi^2</m>.
      Also, for <m>\chi^2</m> tests,
      the hypotheses are usually written in words,
      because they are about the <em>distribution</em>
      of one or more categorical variables,
      not about a single parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      While formulas and conditions vary,
      all of these procedures follow the same basic logic and process.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            For a confidence interval,
            identify the parameter to be estimated and the confidence level.
            For a hypothesis test,
            identify the hypotheses to be tested and the significance level.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Choose the correct procedure.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Check that both conditions for its use are met.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Calculate the confidence interval or the test statistic and p-value,
            as well as the <m>df</m> if applicable.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Interpret the results and draw a conclusion based on the data.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
