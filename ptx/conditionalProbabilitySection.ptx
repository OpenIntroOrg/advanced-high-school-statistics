            What is the likelihood that a machine learning algorithm will misclassify a photo as being about fashion if it is not actually about fashion?

    <p>
      The <c>photo\usclassify</c> data set represents a sample of 1822 photos from a photo sharing website.
      Data scientists have been working to improve a classifier for whether the photo is about fashion or not,
      and these 659 photos represent a test for their classifier.
      Each photo gets two classifications:
      the first is called <c>mach\uslearn</c> and gives a classification from a machine learning<nbsp/>(ML)
          <idx><h>machine learning (ML)</h></idx>
      system of either <c>pred\usfashion</c> or <c>pred\usnot</c>.
      Each of these 1822 photos have also been classified carefully by a team of people,
      which we take to be the source of truth;
      this variable is called <c>truth</c> and takes values <c>fashion</c> and <c>not</c>.
      <xref ref="contTableOfFashionPhotos">Figure</xref> summarizes the results.

      These totals represent <em>marginal probabilities</em><idx><h>marginal probability|textbf</h></idx> for the sample,
      which are the probabilities based on a single variable without regard to any other variables.
      For instance,
      a probability based solely on the <c>mach\uslearn</c> variable is a marginal probability:

      We can compute marginal probabilities using joint probabilities in simple cases.
      For example,
      the probability that a randomly selected photo from the data set is about fashion is found by summing the outcomes in which <c>truth</c> takes value <c>fashion</c>:

    <title>Defining conditional probability</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>conditional probability</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      The ML classifier predicts whether a photo is about fashion,
      even if it is not perfect.
      We would like to better understand how to use information from a variable like <c>mach\uslearn</c> to improve our probability estimation of a second variable,
      which in this example is <c>truth</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The probability that a random photo from the data set is about fashion is about 0.17.
      If we knew the machine learning classifier predicted the photo was about fashion,
      could we get a better estimate of the probability the photo is actually about fashion?
      Absolutely.
      To do so, we limit our view to only those 219 cases where the ML classifier predicted that the photo was about fashion and look at the fraction where the photo was actually about fashion:
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{\texttt{truth} is \texttt{fashion} given \texttt{mach\us{}learn} is \texttt{pred\us{}fashion}} ) = \frac{\fashYY{}}{\fashYA{}} = 0.900</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We call this a <term>conditional probability</term>
      because we computed the probability under a condition:
      the ML classifier prediction said the photo was about fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two parts to a conditional probability,
      the <term>outcome of interest</term>
      and the <term>condition</term>.
      It is useful to think of the condition as information we know to be true,
      and this information usually can be described as a known outcome or<nbsp/>event.
      We generally separate the text inside our probability notation into the outcome of interest and the condition with a vertical bar:
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp \amp  P(\text{\texttt{truth} is \texttt{fashion} given \texttt{mach\us{}learn} is \texttt{pred\us{}fashion}} )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \amp   = P(\text{\texttt{truth} is \texttt{fashion}\ } | \textit{ \texttt{mach\us{}learn} is \texttt{pred\us{}fashion}}) = \frac{\fashYY{}}{\fashYA{}} = 0.900</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The vertical bar
      <q><m>|</m></q>
      is read as <em>given</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last equation,
      we computed the probability a photo was about fashion based on the condition that the ML algorithm predicted it was about fashion as a fraction:
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp  P(\text{\texttt{truth} is \texttt{fashion}\ } | \textit{ \texttt{mach\us{}learn} is \texttt{pred\us{}fashion}})</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \frac{\text{\# cases where \texttt{truth} is \texttt{fashion} and \texttt{mach\us{}learn} is \texttt{pred\us{}fashion}} } {\text{\# cases where \texttt{mach\us{}learn} is \texttt{pred\us{}fashion}} }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \frac{\fashYY{}}{\fashYA{}} = 0.900</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We considered only those cases that met the condition, <c>mach\uslearn</c> is <c>pred\usfashion</c>,
      and then we computed the ratio of those cases that satisfied our outcome of interest,
      photo was actually about fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequently, marginal and joint probabilities are provided instead of count data.
      For example,
      disease rates are commonly listed in percentages rather than in a count format.
      We would like to be able to compute conditional probabilities even when no counts are available,
      and we use the last equation as a template to understand this technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      We considered only those cases that satisfied the condition,
      where the ML algorithm predicted fashion.
      Of these cases,
      the conditional probability was the fraction representing the outcome of interest,
      that the photo was about fashion.
      Suppose we were provided only the information in <xref ref="photoClassifyProbTable">Figure</xref>,
      i.e. only probability data.
      Then if we took a sample of 1000 photos,
      we would anticipate about 12.0% or
      <m>0.120\times 1000 = 120</m> would be predicted to be about fashion (<c>mach\uslearn</c> is <c>pred\usfashion</c>).
      Similarly, we would expect about 10.8% or
      <m>0.108\times 1000 = 108</m> to meet both the information criteria and represent our outcome of interest.
      Then the conditional probability can be computed as
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp P(\text{\texttt{truth} is \texttt{fashion}} \ |\ \text{\texttt{mach\us{}learn} is \texttt{pred\us{}fashion}} )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{\text{\# (\texttt{truth} is \texttt{fashion} and \texttt{mach\us{}learn} is \texttt{pred\us{}fashion})} } {\text{\# (\texttt{mach\us{}learn} is \texttt{pred\us{}fashion})} }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{108}{120} = \frac{0.108}{0.120} = 0.90</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we are examining exactly the fraction of two probabilities, 0.108 and 0.120, which we can write as
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{\texttt{truth} is \texttt{fashion} and \texttt{mach\us{}learn} is \texttt{pred\us{}fashion}} ) \text{ and } P(\text{\texttt{mach\us{}learn} is \texttt{pred\us{}fashion}} )</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fraction of these probabilities is an example of the general formula for conditional probability.

    <p>
      The <c>smallpox</c> data set provides a sample of 6,224 individuals from the year 1721 who were exposed to smallpox in Boston.<fn>
      Fenner F. 1988.
      <em>Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6)</em>.
      Geneva: World Health Organization.
      ISBN 92-4-156110-6.
      </fn> Doctors at the time believed that inoculation,
      which involves exposing a person to the disease in a controlled form,
      could reduce the likelihood of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each case represents one person with two variables: <c>inoculated</c> and <c>result</c>.
      The variable <c>inoculated</c> takes two levels: <c>yes</c> or <c>no</c>,
      indicating whether the person was inoculated or not.
      The variable <c>result</c> has outcomes <c>lived</c> or <c>died</c>.
      These data are summarized in <xref ref="smallpoxContingencyTable">Tables</xref>

    <title>General multiplication rule</title>

      introduced the Multiplication Rule for independent processes.
      Here we provide the <term>General Multiplication Rule</term>
      for events that might not be independent.

      For the term <m>P(A | B)</m>,
      it is useful to think of <m>A</m> as the outcome of interest and <m>B</m> as the condition.\end{onebox} This General Multiplication Rule is simply a rearrangement of the definition for conditional probability.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the <c>smallpox</c> data set.
          Suppose we are given only two pieces of information: 96.08% of residents were not inoculated,
          and 85.88% of the residents who were not inoculated ended up surviving.
          How could we compute the probability that a resident was not inoculated and lived?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          We will compute our answer using the General Multiplication Rule and then verify it using <xref ref="smallpoxProbabilityTable">Figure</xref>.
          We want to determine
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{\texttt{lived} and \texttt{not inoculated}} )</mrow>
          </md>
          and we are given that
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{\texttt{lived}} \ |\ \text{\texttt{not inoculated}} )=0.8588</mrow>
            <mrow>P(\text{\texttt{not inoculated}} )=0.9608</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the 96.08% of people who were not inoculated, 85.88% survived:
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{\texttt{lived} and \texttt{not inoculated}} ) = 0.8588\times 0.9608 = 0.8251</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is equivalent to the General Multiplication Rule.
          We can confirm this probability in <xref ref="smallpoxProbabilityTable">Figure</xref>

      If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent events,

      Mathematically, this is written as

        <mrow>P(A|B) \amp = P(A)</mrow>

    <p>
      The General Multiplication Rule states that
      <m>P(A\text{ and } B)</m> equals <m>P(A | B)\times P(B)</m>.
      If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent events,
      we can replace <m>P(A|B)</m> with <m>P(A)</m> and the following multiplication rule applies:

        <mrow>P(A\text{ and } B) \amp = P(A)\times P(B)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

      <title></title>
      <p>
        When checking whether two events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent,
        verify one of the following equations holds (there is no need to check both equations):
        <md>
          <mrow>P(A|B) \amp = P(A)\amp P(A\text{ and } B) \amp = P(A)\times P(B)</mrow>

      <p>
        If the equation that is checked holds true
        (the left and right sides are equal),
        <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent.
        If the equation does not hold,

          Using <xref ref="contTableOfParStCollegeCopy">Figure</xref>,

            <mrow>P(\text{\texttt{teen} \texttt{college}} \ |\ \text{\texttt{parent} \texttt{degree}} ) \amp \overset{?}{=} P(\text{\texttt{teen} \texttt{college}} )</mrow>

          The value 0.83 came from a probability calculation using <xref ref="contTableOfParStCollegeCopy">Figure</xref>:
          <m>\frac{231}{280} \approx 0.83</m>.
          Because the sides are not equal,
          teenager college attendance and parent degree are dependent.
          That is, we estimate the probability a teenager attended college to be higher if we know that one of the teen's parents has a college degree.

      If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are mutually exclusive events,
      then <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> cannot occur at the same time.
      Mathematically, this is written as

      If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are mutually exclusive events,
      we can replace <m>P(A \text{ and } B)</m> with 0 and the following addition rule applies:
      <md>
        <mrow>P(A\text{ or } B) \amp = P(A) + P(B)</mrow>

        If asked to determine if events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are mutually exclusive,
        verify one of the following equations holds (there is no need to check both equations):
        <md>

        If the equation that is checked holds true
        (the left and right sides are equal),
        <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are mutually exclusive.
        If the equation does not hold,
        then <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are not mutually exclusive.

        If two events are mutually exclusive,

        meaning they must be dependent.
      </p>
      <p>
        If two events are independent, then if one occurs,

      <em>Tree diagrams</em>
          <idx><h>tree diagram|textbf</h></idx>
      are a tool to organize outcomes and probabilities around the structure of the data.
      They are most useful when two or more processes occur in a sequence and each process is conditioned on its predecessors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <c>smallpox</c> data fit this description.
      We see the population as split by <c>inoculation</c>: <c>yes</c> and <c>no</c>.
      Following this split, survival rates were observed for each group.
      This structure is reflected in the tree diagram shown in <xref ref="smallpoxTreeDiagram">Figure</xref>.
      The first branch for <c>inoculation</c> is said to be the <term>primary</term>
      branch while the other branches are <term>secondary</term>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="smallpoxTreeDiagram">
      <caption>A tree diagram of the <c>smallpox</c> data set.</caption>
      \Figure{0.85}{smallpoxTreeDiagram}
    </figure>
    <p>
      Tree diagrams are annotated with marginal and conditional probabilities,
      as shown in <xref ref="smallpoxTreeDiagram">Figure</xref>.
      This tree diagram splits the smallpox data by <c>inoculation</c> into the <c>yes</c> and <c>no</c> groups with respective marginal probabilities 0.0392 and 0.9608.
      The secondary branches are conditioned on the first,
      so we assign conditional probabilities to these branches.
      For example,
      the top branch in <xref ref="smallpoxTreeDiagram">Figure</xref>
      is the probability that <c>lived</c> conditioned on the information that <c>inoculated</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may (and usually do) construct joint probabilities at the end of each branch in our tree by multiplying the numbers we come across as we move from left to right.
      These joint probabilities are computed using the General Multiplication Rule:
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{\texttt{inoculated} and \texttt{lived}} ) \amp = P(\text{\texttt{inoculated}} )\times P(\text{\texttt{lived}} \ |\ \text{\texttt{inoculated}} )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 0.0392\times 0.9754</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =0.0382</mrow>

      In many instances, we are given a conditional probability of the form
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{ statement about variable 1 } \ |\ \text{ statement about variable 2 } )</mrow>
      </md>
      but we would really like to know the inverted conditional probability:

        <mrow>P(\text{ statement about variable 2 } \ |\ \text{ statement about variable 1 } )</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
      instead of wanting to know <m>P(</m>lived <m>|</m> inoculated<m>)</m>,
      we might want to know <m>P(</m>inoculated <m>|</m> lived<m>)</m>.
      This is more challenging because it cannot be read directly from the tree diagram.
      In these instances we use <term>Bayes' Theorem</term>.
      Let's begin by looking at a new example.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="probabilityOfBreastCancerGivenPositiveTestExample">
      <statement>
        <p>
          In Canada, about 0.35% of women over 40 will develop breast cancer in any given year.
          A common screening test for cancer is the mammogram,
          but this test is not perfect.
          In about 11% of patients with breast cancer,
          the test gives a <term>false negative</term>:
          it indicates a woman does not have breast cancer when she does have breast cancer.
          Similarly, the test gives a <term>false positive</term>
          in 7% of patients who do not have breast cancer:
          it indicates these patients have breast cancer when they actually do not.If we tested a random woman over 40 for breast cancer using a mammogram and the test came back positive <mdash/> that is,
          the test suggested the patient has cancer <mdash/> what is the probability that the patient actually has breast cancer?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          We are given sufficient information to quickly compute the probability of testing positive if a woman has breast cancer
          (<m>1.00 - 0.11 = 0.89</m>).
          However, we seek the inverted probability of cancer given a positive test result:
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{ has BC } \ |\ \text{ mammogram\(^+\) } )</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here,
          <q>has BC</q>
          is an abbreviation for the patient actually having breast cancer, and
          <q>mammogram<m>^+</m></q>
          means the mammogram screening was positive,
          which in this case means the test suggests the patient has breast cancer.
          (Watch out for the non-intuitive medical language:
          a<nbsp/><em>positive</em> test result suggests the possible presence of cancer in a mammogram screening.)
          We can use the conditional probability formula from the previous section:
          <m>P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and }  B)}{P(B)}</m>.
          Our conditional probability can be found as follows:
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{ has BC \(|\) mammogram\(^+\) } ) \amp =  \frac{P(\text{ has BC and mammogram\(^+\) } )}{P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) } )}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The probability that a mammogram is positive is as follows.
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) } )=P(\text{ has BC and mammogram\(^+\) } ) +  P(\text{ no BC and mammogram\(^+\) } )</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          A tree diagram is useful for identifying each probability and is shown in <xref ref="BreastCancerTreeDiagram">Figure</xref>.
          Using the tree diagram, we find that
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\amp \text{ has BC \(|\) mammogram\(^+\) } )</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{P(\text{ has BC and mammogram\(^+\) } )}{P(\text{ has BC and mammogram\(^+\) } ) +  P(\text{ no BC and mammogram\(^+\) } )}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{0.0035(0.89)}{0.0035(0.89)+0.9965(0.07)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{0.00312}{0.07288}\approx 0.0428</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          That is, even if a patient has a positive mammogram screening,
          there is still only a<nbsp/>4%<nbsp/>chance that she has breast cancer.
        </p>
      </answer>
    </example>

    </figure>
    <p>
      <xref ref="probabilityOfBreastCancerGivenPositiveTestExample">Example</xref>
      highlights why doctors often run more tests regardless of a first positive test result.
      When a medical condition is rare,
      a single positive test isn't generally definitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider again the last equation of <xref ref="probabilityOfBreastCancerGivenPositiveTestExample">Example</xref>.
      Using the tree diagram, we can see that the numerator
      (the top of the fraction)
      is equal to the following product:
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{ has BC and mammogram\(^+\) } ) = P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) }  | \text{ has BC } )P(\text{ has BC } )</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The denominator <mdash/> the probability the screening was positive <mdash/> is equal to the sum of probabilities for each positive screening scenario:
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{\underline{\color{black}mammogram\(^+\)}} ) \amp = P(\text{\underline{\color{black}mammogram\(^+\)} and no BC} ) + P(\text{\underline{\color{black}mammogram\(^+\)} and has BC} )</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the example,
      each of the probabilities on the right side was broken down into a product of a conditional probability and marginal probability using the tree diagram.
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) } ) \amp = P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) and no BC } ) + P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) and has BC } )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) }  | \text{ no BC } )P(\text{ no BC } )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \qquad\qquad + P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) }  | \text{ has BC } )P(\text{ has BC } )</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can see an application of Bayes' Theorem by substituting the resulting probability expressions into the numerator and denominator of the original conditional probability.
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp  P(\text{ has BC }  | \text{ mammogram\(^+\) } )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  \qquad= \frac{P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) }  | \text{ has BC } )P(\text{ has BC } )} {P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) }  | \text{ no BC } )P(\text{ no BC } ) + P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) }  | \text{ has BC } )P(\text{ has BC } )}</mrow>

      Bayes' Theorem is just a generalization of what we have done using tree diagrams.
      The formula need not be memorized,
      since it can always be derived using a tree diagram:
      <ul>
        <li>

            The numerator identifies the probability of getting both <m>A_1</m> and <m>B</m>.

        <li>

            The denominator is the overall probability of getting <m>B</m>.
            Traverse each branch of the tree diagram that ends with event <m>B</m>.
            Add up the required products.

    <exercise xml:id="exerciseForParkingLotOnCampusBeingFullAndWhetherOrNotThereIsASportingEvent">

        <p>
          Jose visits campus every Thursday evening.
          However, some days the parking garage is full,
          often due to college events.
          There are academic events on 35% of evenings,
          sporting events on 20% of evenings,
          and no events on 45% of evenings.
          When there is an academic event,
          the garage fills up about 25% of the time,
          and it fills up 70% of evenings with sporting events.
          On evenings when there are no events,
          it only fills up about 5% of the time.
          If Jose comes to campus and finds the garage full,
          what is the probability that there is a sporting event?
          Use a tree diagram to solve this problem.

    </exercise>
    <p>
      The last several exercises offered a way to update our belief about whether there is a sporting event,
      academic event,
      or no event going on at the school based on the information that the parking lot was full.
      This strategy of <em>updating beliefs</em>
      using Bayes' Theorem is actually the foundation of an entire section of statistics called
      <term>Bayesian statistics</term>.
      While Bayesian statistics is very important and useful,
      we will not have time to cover it in this book.

          given that <m>B</m> has occurred.
          In a conditional probability,
          we are given some information.

          Sometimes <m>P(A | B)</m> can be deduced.

          <m>P(\text{ 2nd draw is an Ace } | \text{ 1st draw was an Ace } ) = \frac{3}{51}</m>.
          When this is not the case, as when working with a table or a Venn diagram,
          one must use the conditional probability rule <m>P(A | B) = \frac{P(A\text{ and } B)}{P(B)}</m>.

          The resulting answer often has the form <m>\frac{w\times x\text{ } +\text{ } y\times z}{w\times x}</m>,
