      When we have two observations on each person or each case,
      we can answer questions such as the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Do students do better on reading or writing sections of standardized tests?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            How do the number of days with temperature above 90\textdegreeF compare between 1948 and 2018?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Are Amazon textbook prices lower than the college bookstore prices?
            If so, how much lower, on average?

      In the previous edition of this textbook,
      we found that Amazon prices were, on average,
      lower than those of the UCLA Bookstore for UCLA courses in 2010.
      It's been several years,
      and many stores have adapted to the online market,
      so we wondered, how is the UCLA Bookstore doing today?
    </p>
    <p>
      We sampled 201 UCLA courses.
      Of those, 68 required books that could be found on Amazon.
      A<nbsp/>portion of the data set from these courses is shown in <xref ref="textbooksDF">Figure</xref>,
      where prices are in U.S. dollars.

      Each textbook has two corresponding prices in the data set:
      one for the UCLA Bookstore and one for Amazon.
      Therefore, each textbook price from the UCLA bookstore has a natural correspondence with a textbook price from Amazon.
      When two sets of observations have this special correspondence,
      they are said to be <term>paired</term>.

      <p>
        Two sets of observations are <em>paired</em>
        if each observation in one set has a special correspondence or connection with exactly one observation in the other data set.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      To analyze paired data,
      it is often useful to look at the difference in outcomes of each pair of observations.
      In the <c>textbook</c> data set,
      we look at the differences in prices,
      which is represented as the <c>diff</c> variable.
      Here, for each book, the differences are taken as
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ UCLA Bookstore price }  - \text{ Amazon price }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important that we always subtract using a consistent order;
      here Amazon prices are always subtracted from UCLA prices.
      A histogram of these differences is shown in <xref ref="diffInTextbookPricesF18">Figure</xref>.
      Using differences between paired observations is a common and useful way to analyze paired data.

      We will set up and implement a hypothesis test to determine whether,
      on average,
      there is a difference in textbook prices between Amazon and the UCLA bookstore.
      We are considering two scenarios:
      there is no difference in prices or there is some difference in prices.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <title>invalidlabel</title>
          <p>
            <m>\mu_{\textit{{diff}}}=0</m>.
            On average, there is no difference in textbook prices.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>invalidlabel</title>
          <p>
            <m>\mu_{\textit{{diff}}} \neq 0</m>.
            On average, there is some difference in textbook prices.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Can the <m>t</m>-distribution be used for this application?
      The observations are based on a random sample from a large population,
      so independence is reasonable.
      While the distribution of the data is very strongly skewed,
      we do have <m>n = \uclabookN{}</m> observations.
      This sample size is large enough that we do not have to worry about whether the population distribution for difference in price might be nearly normal or not.
      Because the conditions are satisfied,
      we can use the <m>t</m>-distribution to this setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      We compute the standard error associated with
      <m>\bar{x}_{\textit{{diff}}}</m> using the standard deviation of the differences (<m>s_{_{\textit{{diff}}}} = \uclabookSD{}</m>) and the number of differences (<m>n_{_{\textit{{diff}}}} = \uclabookN{}</m>):
      <md>
        <mrow>SE_{\bar{x}_{\textit{{diff}}}} = \frac{s_{\textit{{diff}}}}{\sqrt{n_{\textit{{diff}}}}} = \frac{\uclabookSD{}}{\sqrt{\uclabookN{}}} = \uclabookSE{}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we compute the test statistic.
      The point estimate is the observed value of <m>\bar{x}_{\textit{{diff}}}</m>.
      The null value is the value hypothesized under the null hypothesis.
      Here, the null hypothesis is that the true mean of the differences is 0.
      <md>
        <mrow>T = \frac{\text{ point estimate }  - \text{ null value } } {SE \text{ of estimate } } = \frac{\uclabookM{} - 0}{\uclabookSE{}} = 2.20</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The degrees of freedom are <m>df = \uclabookN{} - 1 = 67</m>.
      To visualize the p-value,
      the sampling distribution of
      <m>\bar{x}_{\textit{{diff}}}</m> is drawn as though <m>H_0</m> is true.
      This is shown in <xref ref="textbooksF18HTTails">Figure</xref>.
      Because this is a two-sided test,
      the p-value corresponds to the area in both tails.
      Using statistical software, we find the area in the tails to be 0.0312.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the p-value of 0.0312 is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
      We have evidence that, on average,
      there is a difference in textbook prices.
      In particular, we can say that,
      on average, Amazon prices are lower than the UCLA Bookstore prices for UCLA course textbooks.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We have evidence to conclude Amazon is,
          on average, less expensive.
          Does this mean that UCLA students should always buy their books on Amazon?
        </p>

      For reference, this is a very different result from what we
      (the authors)
      had seen in a similar data set from 2010.
      At that time, Amazon prices were almost uniformly lower than those of the UCLA Bookstore's and by a large margin,
      making the case to use Amazon over the UCLA Bookstore quite compelling at that time.

        <p>
          An SAT preparation company claims that its students' scores improve by over 100 points on average after their course.
          A consumer group would like to evaluate this claim,
          and they collect data on a random sample of 30 students who took the class.
          Each of these students took the SAT before and after taking the company's course,
          so we have a difference in scores for each student.
          We will examine these differences <m>x_1=57</m>,
          <m>x_2=133</m>, ..., <m>x_{30}=140</m> as a sample to evaluate the company's claim.
          The distribution of the differences,
          shown in <xref ref="satImprovementHTDataHistogramrepeat">Figure</xref>,
          has a mean of 135.9 and a standard deviation of 82.2.
          Do these data provide convincing evidence to back up the company's claim?

              </md>
              The point estimate is the sample mean of differences:
              <m>\bar{x}_{\textit{{diff}}}  = 135.9</m>     The <m>SE</m> of the sample mean of differences is:
              <m>\frac{s_{\textit{{diff}}} }{\sqrt{n_{\textit{{diff}}} }} = \frac{82.2}{\sqrt{30}} = 15.0</m>     Since this is essentially a one sample <m>t</m>-test,
              the degrees of freedom is <m>n_{\textit{{diff}}}-1</m>.
              <md>
                <mrow>T = \frac{135.9-100}{\frac{82.2}{\sqrt{30}}} = \frac{135.9-100}{15.0}=2.4 \qquad df=30-1=29</mrow>
              </md>
              The p-value is the area to the right of 2.4 under the <m>t</m>-distribution with 29 degrees of freedom.
              The p-value = 0.012.

      We construct a 95% confidence interval for the average price difference between books at the UCLA Bookstore and on Amazon.
      Conditions have already verified, namely,
      that we have paired data from a random sample and that the number of differences is at least 30.
      We must find the critical value, <m>t^{\star}</m>.
      Since <m>df = 67</m> is not on the <m>t</m>-table,
      round the <m>df</m> down to 60 to get a
      <m>t^{\star}</m> of 2.00 for 95% confidence.
      (See <xref ref="matchedpairstint">Section</xref>
      for how to get a more precise interval using a calculator.)
      Plugging the <m>t^{\star}</m> value, point estimate,
      and standard error into the confidence interval formula,
      we<nbsp/>get:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ point estimate }  \ \amp \pm\ t^{\star}\times SE\ \text{ of estimate } \to \uclabookM{} \ \amp \pm\ 2.00 \times \frac{\uclabookSD{}}{\sqrt{\uclabookN{}}} \to (0.33\amp ,  6.83)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We are 95% confident that the UCLA bookstore is, on average,
      between $0.33 and $6.83 more expensive than Amazon for UCLA course books.
      This interval does not contain zero,
      so it is consistent with the earlier hypothesis test that <em>rejected</em>
      the null hypothesis that the average difference was 0.
      Because our interval is entirely above 0, we have evidence that the true average difference is greater than zero.
      Unlike the hypothesis test,
      the confidence interval gives us a good idea of how much more expensive the UCLA bookstore might be,
      on average.

          An SAT preparation company claims that its students' scores improve by over 100 points on average after their course.
          A consumer group would like to evaluate this claim,
          and they collect data on a random sample of 30 students who took the class.
          Each of these students took the SAT before and after taking the company's course,
          so we have a difference in scores for each student.
          We will examine these differences <m>x_1=57</m>,
          <m>x_2=133</m>, ..., <m>x_{30}=140</m> as a sample to evaluate the company's claim.
          The distribution of the differences,
          shown in <xref ref="satImprovementHTDataHistogram3">Figure</xref>,
          has a mean of 135.9 and a standard deviation of 82.2.
          Construct a confidence interval to estimate the true average increase in SAT after taking the company's course.
          Is there evidence at the 95% confidence level that students score an average of more than 100 points higher after the class?

          Paired data can come from a {random sample} or a {matched pairs experiment}. With paired data,
          we are often interested in whether the <em>difference</em>
          is positive, negative, or zero.
          For example,
          the difference of paired data from a matched pairs experiment tells us whether one treatment did better, worse,
          or the same as the other treatment for each subject.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We use the notation <m>\bar{x}_{\textit{{diff}}}</m> to represent the mean of the sample differences.
          Likewise, <m>s_{\textit{{diff}}}</m> is the standard deviation of the sample differences,
          and <m>n_{\textit{{diff}}}</m> is the number of sample differences.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To carry out inference on paired data,
          we first find all of the sample differences.
          Then, we perform a one-sample procedure on the <em>differences</em>.
          For this reason,
          the confidence interval and hypothesis test for paired data use the same <m>t</m>-procedures as the one-sample methods,
          where the degrees of freedom is given by <m>n_{\textit{{diff}}}-1</m>.

          Let's consider a limited set of climate data,
          examining temperature differences in 1948 vs<nbsp/>2018.
          We randomly sampled 197 locations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) historical data,
          where the data was available for both years of interest.
          We want to know:
          were there more days with temperatures exceeding 90\textdegreeF in 2018 or in<nbsp/>1948?\footfullcite{webpage:noaa_1948_2018} The difference in number of days exceeding 90\textdegreeF
          (number of days in 2018 - number of days in 1948)
          was calculated for each of the 197 locations.
          The average of these differences was 2.9 days with a standard deviation of 17.2 days.
          We are interested in determining whether these data provide strong evidence that there were more days in 2018 that exceeded 90\textdegreeF from NOAA's weather stations.
