    <p>
      In this section, we investigate bivariate data.
      We examine criteria for identifying a linear model and introduce a new bivariate summary called <em>correlation</em>.
      We answer questions such as the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            How do we quantify the strength of the linear association between two numerical variables?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What does it mean for two variables to have no association or to have a nonlinear association?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Once we fit a model,
            how do we measure the error in the model's predictions?
          </p>

    <title>Fitting a line to data</title>
    <p>
      Requests from twelve separate buyers were simultaneously placed with a trading company to purchase Target Corporation stock
      (ticker <c>TGT</c>, April 26th, 2012).
      We let <m>x</m> be the number of stocks to purchase and <m>y</m> be the total cost.
      Because the cost is computed using a linear formula,
      the linear fit is perfect, and the equation for the line is:
      <m>y = 5 + 57.49x</m>.
      If we know the number of stocks purchased,
      we can determine the cost based on this linear equation with no error.
      Additionally,
      we can say that each additional share of the stock cost $57.49 and that there was a $5 fee for the transaction.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="perfLinearModel">
      <caption>Total cost of a trade against number of shares purchased.</caption>
      \Figure{0.5}{perfLinearModel}
    </figure>
    <p>
      Perfect linear relationships are unrealistic in almost any natural process.
      For example, if we took family income (<m>x</m>),
      this value would provide some useful information about how much financial support a college may offer a prospective student
      (<m>y</m>).
      However, the prediction would be far from perfect,
      since other factors play a role in financial support beyond a family's income.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is rare for all of the data to fall perfectly on a straight line.
      Instead, it's more common for data to appear as a
      <em>cloud of points</em>,
      such as those shown in <xref ref="imperfLinearModel">Figure</xref>.
      In each case, the data fall around a straight line,
      even if none of the observations fall exactly on the line.
      The first plot shows a relatively strong downward linear trend,
      where the remaining variability in the data around the line is minor relative to the strength of the relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      The second plot shows an upward trend that,
      while evident, is not as strong as the first.
      The last plot shows a very weak downward trend in the data,
      so slight we can hardly notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In each of these examples, we can consider how to draw a
      <q>best fit line</q>. For instance, we might wonder,
      should we move the line up or down a little,
      or should we tilt it more or less?
      As we move forward in this chapter,
      we will learn different criteria for line-fitting,
      and we will also learn about the uncertainty associated with estimates of model parameters.

    <p>
      We will also see examples in this chapter where fitting a straight line to the data,
      even if there is a clear relationship between the variables,
      is not helpful.
      One such case is shown in <xref ref="notGoodAtAllForALinearModel">Figure</xref>
      where there is a very strong relationship between the variables even though the trend is not linear.

    <title>Using linear regression to predict possum head lengths</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>data</h><h>possum</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      Brushtail possums are a marsupial that lives in Australia.
      A photo of one is shown in <xref ref="possumpic">Figure</xref>.
      Researchers captured 104 of these animals and took body measurements before releasing the animals back into the wild.
      We consider two of these measurements:
      the total length of each possum,
      from head to tail, and the length of each possum's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="scattHeadLTotalL">Figure</xref>
      shows a scatterplot for the head length and total length of the 104 possums.
      Each point represents a single point from the data.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="possumpic">

    <figure xml:id="scattHeadLTotalL">
      <caption>A scatterplot showing head length against total length for 104 brushtail possums. A point representing a possum with head length 94.1<nbsp/>mm and total length 89<nbsp/>cm is highlighted.</caption>
      <image width="80%" source="images/scattHeadLTotalL.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      The head and total length variables are associated:
      possums with an above average total length also tend to have above average head lengths.
      While the relationship is not perfectly linear,
      it could be helpful to partially explain the connection between these variables with a straight line.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to describe the relationship between the head length and total length variables in the possum data set using a line.
      In this example, we will use the total length, <m>x</m>,
      to explain or predict a possum's head length, <m>y</m>.
      When we use <m>x</m> to predict <m>y</m>,
      we usually call <m>x</m> the <term>explanatory variable</term> or predictor variable,
      and we call <m>y</m> the <term>response variable</term>.
      We could fit the linear relationship by eye,
      as in <xref ref="scattHeadLTotalLLine">Figure</xref>.
      The equation for this line is
      <md>
        <mrow>\hat{y} = 41 + 0.59x</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      A
      <q>hat</q>
      on <m>y</m> is used to signify that this is a predicted value,
      not an observed value.
      We can use this line to discuss properties of possums.
      For instance,
      the equation predicts a possum with a total length of 80<nbsp/>cm will have a head length of
      <md>
        <mrow>\hat{y} \amp = 41 + 0.59(80)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 88.2</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The value <m>\hat{y}</m> may be viewed as an average:
      the equation predicts that possums with a total length of 80<nbsp/>cm will have an average head length of 88.2<nbsp/>mm.
      The value <m>\hat{y}</m> is also a prediction:
      absent further information about an 80<nbsp/>cm possum,
      this is our best prediction for a the head length of a single 80<nbsp/>cm possum.

    <title>Residuals</title>

    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Residuals</em>
          <idx><h>residual|textbf</h></idx>
      are the leftover variation in the response variable after fitting a model.
      Each observation will have a residual,
      and three of the residuals for the linear model we fit for the <c>possum</c> data are shown in <xref ref="scattHeadLTotalLLine">Figure</xref>.
      If an observation is above the regression line, then its residual,
      the vertical distance from the observation to the line,
      is positive.
      Observations below the line have negative residuals.
      One goal in picking the right linear model is for these residuals to be as small as possible.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="scattHeadLTotalLLine">
      <caption>A reasonable linear model was fit to represent the relationship between head length and total length.</caption>
      <image width="70%" source="images/scattHeadLTotalLLine.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      Let's look closer at the three residuals featured in <xref ref="scattHeadLTotalLLine">Figure</xref>.
      The observation marked by an
      <q><times/></q>
      has a small, negative residual of about -1;
      the observation marked by
      <q><m>+</m></q>
      has a large residual of about +7;
      and the observation marked by
      <q><m>\triangle</m></q>
      has a moderate residual of about -4.
      The size of a residual is usually discussed in terms of its absolute value.
      For example, the residual for
      <q><m>\triangle</m></q>
      is larger than that of
      <q><times/></q>
      because <m>|-4|</m> is larger than <m>|-1|</m>.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title></title>
      <p>
        The residual for a particular observation
        <m>(x, \ y)</m> is the difference between the observed response and the response we would predict based on the model:
        <md>
          <mrow>\text{ residual }  =\amp  \ \text{ observed }  y - \text{ predicted }  y</mrow>
          <mrow>=\amp \  y - \hat{y}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        We typically identify <m>\hat{y}</m> by plugging <m>x</m> into the model.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The linear fit shown in <xref ref="scattHeadLTotalLLine">Figure</xref>
          is given as <m>\hat{y} = 41 + 0.59x</m>.
          Based on this line,
          compute and interpret the residual of the observation <m>(77.0, \ 85.3)</m>.
          This observation is denoted by
          <q><times/></q>
          on the plot.
          Recall that <m>x</m> is the total length measured in<nbsp/>cm and <m>y</m> is head length measured in<nbsp/>mm.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          We first compute the predicted value based on the model:
          <md>
            <mrow>\hat{y} =\amp  \ 41+0.59x</mrow>
            <mrow>=\amp  \ 41+0.59(77.0)</mrow>
            <mrow>=\amp  \  86.4</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Next we compute the difference of the actual head length and the predicted head length:
          <md>
            <mrow>residual =\amp  \ y - \hat{y}</mrow>
            <mrow>=\amp  \ 85.3 -  86.4</mrow>
            <mrow>=\amp  \ -1.1</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The residual for this point is -1.1<nbsp/>mm,
          which is very close to the visual estimate of -1<nbsp/>mm.
          For this particular possum with total length of 77<nbsp/>cm,
          the model's prediction for its head length was 1.1<nbsp/>mm <em>too high</em>.

          in the figure, using the linear model:

        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      Residuals are helpful in evaluating how well a linear model fits a data set.
      We often display the residuals in a
      <term>residual plot</term>
      such as the one shown in <xref ref="scattHeadLTotalLResidualPlotReproduced">Figure</xref>.
      Here, the residuals are calculated for each <m>x</m> value,
      and plotted versus <m>x</m>.
      For instance,
      the point <m>(85.0,98.6)</m> had a residual of 7.45,
      so in the residual plot it is placed at <m>(85.0, 7.45)</m>.
      Creating a residual plot is sort of like tipping the scatterplot over so the regression line is horizontal.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the residual plot, we can better estimate the
      <term>standard deviation of the residuals</term>,
      often denoted by the letter <m>s</m>.
      The standard deviation of the residuals tells us typical size of the residuals.
      As such, it is a measure of the typical deviation between the <m>y</m> values and the model predictions.
      In other words,
      it tells us the typical prediction error using the model.<fn>
      The standard deviation of the residuals is calculated as:
      <m>s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum{(y_i-\hat{y})^2}}{n-2}}</m>.
      </fn>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Estimate the standard deviation of the residuals for predicting head length from total length using the line:
          <m>\hat{y} = 41+0.59x</m> using <xref ref="scattHeadLTotalLResidualPlotReproduced">Figure</xref>.
          Also, interpret the quantity in context.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          To estimate this graphically, we use the residual plot.
          The approximate 68, 95 rule for standard deviations applies.
          Approximately 2/3 of the points are within <m>\pm</m> 2.5 and approximately 95% of the points are within <m>\pm</m> 5, so 2.5 is a good estimate for the standard deviation of the residuals.
          The typical error when predicting head length using this model is about 2.5<nbsp/>mm.

          One purpose of residual plots is to identify characteristics or patterns still apparent in data after fitting a model.
          <xref ref="sampleLinesAndResPlots">Figure</xref>
          shows three scatterplots with linear models in the first row and residual plots in the second row.
          Can you identify any patterns remaining in the residuals?

      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          In the first data set
          (first column),
          the residuals show no obvious patterns.
          The residuals appear to be scattered randomly around the dashed line that represents 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second data set shows a pattern in the residuals.
          There is some curvature in the scatterplot,
          which is more obvious in the residual plot.
          We should not use a straight line to model these data.
          Instead, a more advanced technique should be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last plot shows very little upwards trend,
          and the residuals also show no obvious patterns.
          It is reasonable to try to fit a linear model to the data.
          However, it is unclear whether there is statistically significant evidence that the slope parameter is different from zero.
          The slope of the sample regression line is not zero,
          but we might wonder if this could be due to random variation.
          We will address this sort of scenario in <xref ref="inferenceForLinearRegression">Section</xref>.

    <title>Describing linear relationships with correlation</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>correlation</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      When a linear relationship exists between two variables,
      we can quantify the strength and direction of the linear relation with the correlation coefficient,
      or just <term>correlation</term> for short.
      <xref ref="posNegCorPlots">Figure</xref>
      shows eight plots and their corresponding correlations.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="posNegCorPlots">
      <caption>Sample scatterplots and their correlations. The first row shows variables with a positive relationship, represented by the trend up and to the right. The second row shows variables with a negative trend, where a large value in one variable is associated with a low value in the other.</caption>
      <image width="80%" source="images/posNegCorPlots.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      Only when the relationship is perfectly linear is the correlation either <m>-1</m> or 1.
      If<nbsp/>the linear relationship is strong and positive,
      the correlation will be near +1.
      If it is strong and negative,
      it will be near <m>-1</m>.
      If<nbsp/>there is no apparent linear relationship between the variables,
      then the correlation will be near zero.

      <p>
        <em>Correlation</em>,
            <idx><h>correlation|textbf</h></idx>
        which always takes values between -1 and 1, describes the direction and strength of the linear relationship between two numerical variables.
        The strength can be strong, moderate, or<nbsp/>weak.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      We compute the correlation using a formula,
      just as we did with the sample mean and standard deviation.
      Formally, we can compute the correlation for observations <m>(x_1, y_1)</m>,
      <m>(x_2, y_2)</m>, ..., <m>(x_n, y_n)</m> using the formula
      <md>
        <mrow>r =\frac{1}{n-1}\sum{\Big(\frac{x_i-\bar{x}}{s_x}\Big)\Big(\frac{y_i-\bar{y}}{s_y}\Big)}</mrow>
      </md>
      where <m>\bar{x}</m>, <m>\bar{y}</m>, <m>s_x</m>,
      and <m>s_y</m> are the sample means and standard deviations for each variable.
      This formula is rather complex,
      and we generally perform the calculations on a computer or calculator.
      We can note, though,
      that the computation involves taking, for each point,
      the product of the Z-scores that correspond to the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> values.

      <answer>
        <p>
          Here, changing the units of <m>y</m> corresponds to multiplying all the <m>y</m> values by a certain number.
          This would change the mean and the standard deviation of <m>y</m>,
          but it would not change the correlation.
          To see this,
          imagine dividing every number on the vertical axis by 10.
          The units of <m>y</m> are now in<nbsp/>cm rather than in<nbsp/>mm,
          but the graph has remain exactly the same.
          The units of <m>y</m> have changed,
          by the relative distance of the <m>y</m> values about the mean are the same;
          that is, the Z-scores corresponding to the <m>y</m><nbsp/>values have remained the same.

        The correlation, <m>r</m>,

      Correlation is intended to quantify the strength of a linear trend.
      Nonlinear trends, even when strong,
      sometimes produce correlations that do not reflect the strength of the relationship;

          This group of four graphs, known as Anscombe's Quartet,
          remind us that knowing the value of the correlation does not tell us what the corresponding scatterplot looks like.

    <title>Section summary</title>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          In Chapter 2 we introduced a bivariate display called a <em>scatterplot</em>,
            <idx><h>scatterplot|textbf</h></idx>
          which shows the relationship between two numerical variables.
          When we use <m>x</m> to predict <m>y</m>,
          we call <m>x</m> the <term>explanatory variable</term> or predictor variable,
          and we call <m>y</m> the <term>response variable</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A linear model for bivariate numerical data can be useful for prediction when the association between the variables follows a constant,
          linear trend.
          Linear models should not be used if the trend between the variables is curved.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When we write a linear model,
          we use <m>\hat{y}</m> to indicate that it is the model or the prediction.
          The value <m>\hat{y}</m> can be understood as a <term>prediction</term>
          for <m>y</m> based on a given <m>x</m>,
          or as an <term>average</term> of the <m>y</m> values for a given <m>x</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>residual</term> is the <em>error</em>
          between the true value and the modeled value,
          computed as <m>y - \hat{y}</m>.
          The order of the difference matters,
          and the sign of the residual will tell us if the model overpredicted or underpredicted a particular data point.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The symbol <m>s</m> in a linear model is used to denote the standard deviation of the residuals,
          and it measures the typical prediction error by the model.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A <term>residual plot</term> is a scatterplot with the residuals on the vertical axis.
          The residuals are often plotted against <m>x</m> on the horizontal axis,
          but they can also be plotted against <m>y</m>,
          <m>\hat{y}</m>, or other variables.
          Two important uses of a residual plot are the following.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Residual plots help us see patterns in the data that may not have been apparent in the scatterplot.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The standard deviation of the residuals is easier to estimate from a residual plot than from the original scatterplot.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Correlation</em>,
            <idx><h>correlation|textbf</h></idx>
          denoted with the letter <m>r</m>,
          measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship.
          The following are some important facts about correlation.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The value of <m>r</m> is always between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>,
                inclusive,
                with an <m>r=-1</m> indicating a perfect negative relationship
                (points fall exactly along a line that has negative slope)
                and an <m>r=1</m> indicating a perfect positive relationship
                (points fall exactly along a line that has positive slope).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                An <m>r=0</m> indicates no <em>linear</em>
                association between the variables,
                though there may well exist a quadratic or other type of association.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Just like Z-scores, the correlation has no units.
                Changing the units in which <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> are measured does not affect the correlation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Correlation is sensitive to outliers.
                Adding or removing a single point can have a big effect on the correlation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                As we learned previously, correlation is not causation.
                Even a very strong correlation cannot prove causation;
                only a well-designed, controlled,
                randomized experiment can prove causation.
              </p>

      <title>Crawling babies, Part I</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A study conducted at the University of Denver investigated whether babies take longer to learn to crawl in cold months,
          when they are often bundled in clothes that restrict their movement,
          than in warmer months. \footfullcite{Benson:1993} Infants born during the study year were split into twelve groups,
          one for each birth month.
          We consider the average crawling age of babies in each group against the average temperature when the babies are six months old
          (that's when babies often begin trying to crawl).
          Temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit (^\circ F) and age is measured in weeks.
