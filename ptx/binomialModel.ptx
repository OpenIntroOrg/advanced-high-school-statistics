      What is the probabilty that more than half of a random sample of 40 people would have blood type O+? If the probability of a defective part is 1%, how many defective items would we expect in a random shipment of 200 of those parts?
      We can model these scenarios and answer these questions using the binomial distribution.

    <title>An example of a binomial distribution</title>
    <p>
      In Guided <xref ref="bloodTypeOPos">Practice</xref>,
      we asked various probability questions regarding the number of people out of 4 with blood type O+. We verified that the scenario was binomial and that each problem could be solved using the binomial formula.
      Instead of looking at it piecewise,
      we could describe the entire <em>distribution</em>
      of possible values and their corresponding probabilities.
      Since there are 4 people,
      there are several possible outcomes for the number who might have blood type O+: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
      We can make a distribution table with these outcomes.
      Recall that the probability of a randomly sampled person being blood type O+ is about<nbsp/>0.35.

    <title>The mean and standard deviation of a binomial distribution</title>

      Since this is a probability distribution we could find its mean and standard deviation using the formulas from <xref ref="probability">Chapter</xref>.
      Those formulas require a lot of calculations,
      so it is fortunate there's an easier way to compute the mean and standard deviation for a binomial random variable.

        the mean and standard deviation of the number of observed successes are

    <p>
      The binomial formula is cumbersome when the sample size (<m>n</m>) is large,
      particularly when we consider a range of observations.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the probability that fewer than 12 out of 40 randomly selected people would have blood type O+, where probability of blood type O+ is 0.35.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          This is equivalent to asking,
          what is the probability of observing
          <m>X=0, 1, 2, ..., \text{ or }  11</m> with blood type O+ in a sample of size 40 when <m>p=0.35</m>?
          We previously verified that this scenario is binomial.
          We can compute each of the 12 probabilities using the binomial formula and add them together to find the answer:
          <md>
            <mrow>\amp P(X=0\text{ or } X=1\text{ or } \cdots\text{ or }  X=11)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \qquad = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + \cdots + P(X=11)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \qquad = {40\choose 0}(\oposprob{})^0(\oposprobcomp{})^{40} + {40\choose 1}(\oposprob{})^1(\oposprobcomp{})^{39} + \cdots + {40\choose 11}(\oposprob{})^{11}(\oposprobcomp{})^{29}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \qquad = 0.21</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          If the true proportion with blood type O+ in the population is <m>p = \oposprob{}</m>,
          then the probability of observing fewer than 12 in a sample of <m>n = 40</m> is 0.21.
        </p>
      </answer>
    </example>
    <p>
      The computations in <xref ref="exactbin">Example</xref> are tedious and long.
      In general, we should avoid such work if an alternative method exists that is faster,
      easier, and still accurate.
      Recall that calculating probabilities of a range of values is much easier in the normal model.
      In some cases we may use the normal distribution to estimate binomial probabilities.
      While a normal approximation for the distribution in <xref ref="oPositive4">Figure</xref>
      when the sample size was <m>n = 4</m> would not be appropriate,
      it might not be too bad for the distribution in <xref ref="oPositive40">Figure</xref> where <m>n = 40</m>.
      We might wonder,
      when is it reasonable to use the normal model to approximate a binomial distribution?
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Here we consider the binomial model when the probability of a success is <m>p=0.10</m>.
          <xref ref="fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal">Figure</xref>
          shows four hollow histograms for simulated samples from the binomial distribution using four different sample sizes:
          <m>n=10</m>, 30, 100, 300.
          What happens to the shape of the distributions as the sample size increases?
          How does the binomial distribution change as <m>n</m> gets larger?

    <p>
      The shape of the binomial distribution depends upon both <m>n</m> and <m>p</m>.
      Here we introduce a rule of thumb for when normal approximation of a binomial distribution is reasonable.
      We will use this rule of thumb in many applications going forward.

        The binomial distribution with probability of success <m>p</m> is nearly normal when the sample size <m>n</m> is sufficiently large that
        <m>np\ge 10</m> and <m>n(1-p)\ge 10</m>.
        The approximate normal distribution has parameters corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of the binomial distribution:

    <p>
      The normal approximation may be used when computing the range of many possible successes.
      For instance,
      we may apply the normal distribution to the setting described in <xref ref="oPositive40">Figure</xref>.

      We consider again our example where 35% of people are blood type O+. Suppose we want to find the probability that between 129 and 131 people,
      inclusive,
      have blood type O+ in a random sample of 400 people.
      We want to compute the probability of observing 129, 130,
      or 131 people with blood type O+ when <m>p=0.20</m> and <m>n=400</m>.
      With such a large sample,
      we might be tempted to apply the normal approximation and use the range 129 to 131.
      However, we would find that the binomial solution and the normal approximation notably differ:

      We can identify the cause of this discrepancy using <xref ref="normApproxToBinomFail">Figure</xref>,
      which shows the areas representing the binomial probability (outlined) and normal approximation
      (shaded).
      Notice that the width of the area under the normal distribution is 0.5 units too slim on both sides of the interval.
      The binomial distribution is a discrete distribution,
      and the each bar is centered over an integer value.
      Looking closely at <xref ref="normApproxToBinomFail">Figure</xref>,
      we can see that the bar corresponding to 129 begins at 128.5 and ends at 129.5, the bar corresponding to 131 begins at 130.5 and ends at 131.5, etc.

        The normal approximation to the binomial distribution for intervals of values is usually improved if cutoff values for the lower end of a shaded region are reduced by 0.5 and the cutoff value for the upper end are increased by 0.5.
        This correction is called the continuity correction and accounts for the fact that the binomial distribution is discrete.

      It is always possible to apply the continuity correction when finding a normal approximation to the binomial distribution.

      the benefit of the modification is limited since the added area becomes negligible compared to the overall area being calculated.

    <p>
      In the previous chapter,
      we introduced the binomial formula to find the probability of exactly <m>x</m> successes in <m>n</m> trials for an event that has probability <m>p</m> of success.
      Instead of looking at this scenario piecewise,
      we can describe the entire <em>distribution</em>
      of the number of successes and their corresponding probabilities.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The distribution of the <em>number of successes</em>
          in <m>n</m> independent trials gives rise to a
          <term>binomial distribution</term>.
          If X has a binomial distribution with parameters <m>n</m> and <m>p</m>,
          then <m>P(X=x) = {n\choose x}p^x(1-p)^n-x</m>,
          where <m>x=0,1,2,3\dots,n</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To write out a binomial probability
          <em>distribution table</em>,
          list all possible values for <m>x</m>, the number of successes,
          then use the binomial formula to find the probability of each of those values.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Because a binomial distribution can be thought of as the
          <em>sum</em> of a bunch of 0s and 1s,
          the <term>Central Limit Theorem</term> applies.
          As <m>n</m> gets larger,
          the shape of the binomial distribution becomes more normal.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We call the rule of thumb for when the binomial distribution can be well modeled with a normal distribution the
          <term>success-failure</term> condition.
