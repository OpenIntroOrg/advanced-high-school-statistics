          The scatterplots shown below each have a superimposed regression line.

          (residuals versus <m>x</m>)
          for each, describe what those plots would look like.

          Shown below are two plots of residuals remaining after fitting a linear model to two different sets of data.

          (in g)
          of cats from their body weight

        <p>
          Many people believe that gender, weight, drinking habits,
          and many other factors are much more important in predicting blood alcohol content (BAC) than simply considering the number of drinks a person consumed.
          Here we examine data from sixteen student volunteers at Ohio State University who each drank a randomly assigned number of cans of beer.
          These students were evenly divided between men and women,
          and they differed in weight and drinking habits.
          Thirty minutes later,
          a police officer measured their blood alcohol content (BAC) in grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood.\footfullcite{Malkevitc+Lesser:2008} The scatterplot and regression table summarize the findings.

        <p>
          Many college courses conclude by giving students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor anonymously.
          However, the use of these student evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of non-teaching related characteristics,
          such as the physical appearance of the instructor.
          Researchers at University of Texas, Austin collected data on teaching evaluation score
          (higher score means better)
          and standardized beauty score (a score of 0 means average,
          negative score means below average,
          and a positive score means above average) for a sample of 463 professors.\footfullcite{Hamermesh:2005} The scatterplot below shows the relationship between these variables,
          and also provided is a regression output for predicting teaching evaluation score from beauty score.

          Is the gestational age
          (time between conception and birth)
          of a low birth-weight baby useful in predicting head circumference at birth?
          Twenty-five low birth-weight babies were studied at a Harvard teaching hospital;
          the investigators calculated the regression of head circumference
          (measured in centimeters)
          against gestational age
          (measured in weeks).
          The estimated regression line is
