  <title>Defining probability</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      What is the probability of rolling an even number on a die?
      Of getting 5 heads in row when tossing a coin?
      Of drawing a Heart or an Ace from a deck of cards?
      The study of probability is fun and interesting in its own right,
      but it also forms the foundation for statistical models and inferential procedures,
      many of which we will investigate in subsequent chapters.

        <p>
          A
          <q>die</q>, the singular of dice,
          is a cube with six faces numbered <c>1</c>, <c>2</c>, <c>3</c>, <c>4</c>, <c>5</c>,
          and <c>6</c>.
          What is the chance of getting <c>1</c> when rolling a die?

      <answer>
        <p>
          If the die is fair,
          then the chance of a <c>1</c> is as good as the chance of any other number.
          Since there are six outcomes,
          the chance must be 1-in-6 or, equivalently, <m>1/6</m>.

        <p>
           <c>1</c> and <c>2</c> constitute two of the six equally likely possible outcomes,

      Rolling a die or flipping a coin is a seemingly random process and each gives rise to an outcome.

      <p>
        The <term>probability</term> of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.

    <p>
      Probability is defined as a proportion,
      and it always takes values between 0<nbsp/>and<nbsp/>1
      (inclusively).
      It may also be displayed as a percentage between 0% and 100%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probability can be illustrated by rolling a die many times.
      Consider the event
      <q>roll a 1</q>. The <term>relative frequency</term>
      of an event is the proportion of times the event occurs out of the number of trials.
      Let <m>\hat{p}_n</m> be the proportion of outcomes that are <c>1</c> after the first <m>n</m> rolls.
      As the number of rolls increases, <m>\hat{p}_n</m>
      (the relative frequency of rolls)
      will converge to the probability of rolling a <c>1</c>,
      <m>p = 1/6</m>.
      <xref ref="dieProp">Figure</xref>
      shows this convergence for 100,000 die rolls.
      The tendency of <m>\hat{p}_n</m> to stabilize around <m>p</m>,
      that<nbsp/>is,
      the tendency of the relative frequency to stabilize around the true probability,
      is described by the <term>Law of Large Numbers</term>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="dieProp">
      <caption>The fraction of die rolls that are 1 at each stage in a simulation. The relative frequency tends to get closer to the probability <m>1/6 \approx 0.167</m> as the number of rolls increases.</caption>

      <p>
        As more observations are collected,
        the observed proportion <m>\hat{p}_n</m> of occurrences with a particular outcome after <m>n</m> trials converges to the true probability <m>p</m> of that outcome.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      Occasionally the proportion will veer off from the probability and appear to defy the Law of Large Numbers,
      as <m>\hat{p}_n</m> does many times in <xref ref="dieProp">Figure</xref>.
      However, these deviations become smaller as the number of rolls increases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above we write <m>p</m> as the probability of rolling a <c>1</c>.
      We can also write this probability as
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{rolling a \texttt{1}} )</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      As we become more comfortable with this notation,
      we will abbreviate it further.
      For instance, if it is clear that the process is
      <q>rolling a die</q>, we could abbreviate <m>P(</m>rolling a <c>1</c><m>)</m> as<nbsp/><m>P(</m><c>1</c><m>)</m>.

      What we think of as random processes are not necessarily random,

      suggests a roommate's behavior is a random process.
      However, even if a roommate's behavior is not truly random,
      modeling her behavior as a random process can still be useful.

    <title>Disjoint or mutually exclusive outcomes</title>

    </p>
    <p>
      Two outcomes are called <term>disjoint</term>
      or <term>mutually exclusive</term>
      if they cannot both happen in the same trial.
      For instance, if we roll a die,
      the outcomes <c>1</c> and <c>2</c> are disjoint since they cannot both occur on a single roll.
      On the other hand,
      the outcomes <c>1</c> and
      <q>rolling an odd number</q>
      are not disjoint since both occur if the outcome of the roll is a <c>1</c>.
      The terms <em>disjoint</em> and
      <em>mutually exclusive</em>
      are equivalent and interchangeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculating the probability of disjoint outcomes is easy.
      When rolling a die,
      the outcomes <c>1</c> and <c>2</c> are disjoint,
      and we compute the probability that one of these outcomes will occur by adding their separate probabilities:
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{\texttt{1} or \texttt{2}} ) = P(\text{\texttt{1}} )+P(\text{\texttt{2}} ) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      What about the probability of rolling a <c>1</c>, <c>2</c>, <c>3</c>, <c>4</c>, <c>5</c>,
      or <c>6</c>?
      Here again, all of the outcomes are disjoint so we add the probabilities:
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp \amp P(\text{\texttt{1} or \texttt{2} or \texttt{3} or \texttt{4} or \texttt{5} or \texttt{6}} )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \amp = P(\text{\texttt{1}} )+P(\text{\texttt{2}} )+P(\text{\texttt{3}} )+P(\text{\texttt{4}} )+P(\text{\texttt{5}} )+P(\text{\texttt{6}} )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \amp = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <term>Addition Rule</term> guarantees the accuracy of this approach when the outcomes are disjoint.

    <title>Probabilities when events are not disjoint</title>
    <p>
      Let's consider calculations for two events that are not disjoint in the context of a regular deck of 52 cards,
          <idx><h>deck of cards</h></idx>
      represented in <xref ref="deckOfCards">Figure</xref>.
      If you are unfamiliar with the cards in a regular deck,
      please see the footnote.<fn>
      The 52 cards are split into four <term>suits</term>:
      <m>\clubsuit</m> (club), {<m>\diamondsuit</m>} (diamond), {<m>\heartsuit</m>} (heart),
      <m>\spadesuit</m>
      (spade).
      Each suit has its 13 cards labeled: <c>2</c>, <c>3</c>, ..., <c>10</c>, <c>J</c> (jack), <c>Q</c> (queen), <c>K</c> (king),
      and <c>A</c> (ace).
      Thus, each card is a unique combination of a suit and a label,
      e.g. {<c>4<m>\heartsuit</m></c>} and <c>J<m>\clubsuit</m></c>.
      The 12 cards represented by the jacks, queens,
      and kings are called \termsub{<c>face cards</c>}{face card}. The cards that are {<m>\diamondsuit</m>} or {<m>\heartsuit</m>} are typically colored {red} while the other two suits are typically colored black.

      <term>Venn diagrams</term> are useful when outcomes can be categorized as
      <q>in</q>
      or
      <q>out</q>
      for two or three variables, attributes, or random processes.
      The Venn diagram in <xref ref="venn">Figure</xref>
      uses a circle to represent diamonds and another to represent face cards.
      If a card is both a diamond and a face card,
      it falls into the intersection of the circles.
      If it is a diamond but not a face card,
      it will be in part of the left circle that is not in the right circle
      (and so on).
      The total number of cards that are diamonds is given by the total number of cards in the diamonds circle:
      <m>10+3=13</m>.
      The probabilities are also shown (e.g.
      <m>10/52 = 0.1923</m>).

    <p>
      Let <m>A</m> represent the event that a randomly selected card is a diamond and <m>B</m> represent the event that it is a face card.
      How do we compute <m>P(A</m> or <m>B)</m>?
      Events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are not disjoint <mdash/> the cards {<m>J\diamondsuit</m>}, {<m>Q\diamondsuit</m>}, and {<m>K\diamondsuit</m>} fall into both categories <mdash/> so we cannot use the Addition Rule for disjoint events.
      Instead we use the Venn diagram.
      We start by adding the probabilities of the two events:
      <md>
        <mrow>P(A) + P(B) = P({\color{redcards}\diamondsuit}) + P(\text{ face card } ) = 13/52 + 12/52</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the three cards that are in both events were counted twice,
      once in each probability.
      We must correct this double counting:
      <md>
        <mrow>P(A\text{ or }  B) \amp =\amp P({\color{redcards}\diamondsuit}) + P(\text{ face card } )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\amp  P({\color{redcards}\diamondsuit}) + P(\text{ face card } ) - P({\color{redcards}\diamondsuit}  \text{ and face card } )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\amp  13/52 + 12/52 - 3/52</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\amp  22/52 = 11/26</mrow>

      This set of all possible outcomes is called the <term>sample space</term>

    <title>Independence</title>
    <p>
      Just as variables and observations can be independent,
      random processes can be independent, too.
      Two processes are <term>independent</term>
      if knowing the outcome of one provides no useful information about the outcome of the other.
      For instance,
      flipping a coin and rolling a die are two independent processes <mdash/> knowing the coin was heads does not help determine the outcome of a die roll.
      On the other hand, stock prices usually move up or down together,
      so they are not independent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="probOf2Ones">Example</xref>
      provides a basic example of two independent processes:
      rolling two dice.
      We want to determine the probability that both will be <c>1</c>.
      Suppose one of the dice is red and the other white.
      If the outcome of the red die is a <c>1</c>,
      it provides no information about the outcome of the white die.
      We first encountered this same question in <xref ref="probOf2Ones">Example</xref>
      (<xref ref="probOf2Ones">page</xref>),
      where we calculated the probability using the following reasoning:
      <m>1/6^{th}</m> of the time the red die is a <c>1</c>,
      and <m>1/6^{th}</m> of <em>those</em>
      times the white die will also be <c>1</c>.
      This is illustrated in <xref ref="indepForRollingTwo1s">Figure</xref>.
      Because the rolls are independent,
      the probabilities of the corresponding outcomes can be multiplied to get the final answer:
      <m>(1/6)\times(1/6)=1/36</m>.
      This can be generalized to many independent processes.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="indepForRollingTwo1s">
      <caption><m>1/6^{th}</m> of the time, the first roll is a <c>1</c>. Then <m>1/6^{th}</m> of <em>those</em> times, the second roll will also be a <c>1</c>.</caption>

      Sometimes we wonder if one outcome provides useful information about another outcome.
      The question we are asking is,
      are the occurrences of the two events independent?
      We say that two events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent if they satisfy Equation<nbsp/><xref ref="eqForIndependentEvents" />.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If we shuffle up a deck of cards and draw one,
          is the event that the card is a heart independent of the event that the card is an ace?

          When an outcome depends upon a chance process,
          we can define the <term>probability</term>
          of the outcome as the proportion of times it would occur if we repeated the process an infinite number of times.
          Also, even when an outcome is not truly random,
          modeling it with probability can be useful.

        <p>
          The <term>Law of Large Numbers</term>
          states that the <term>relative frequency</term>,
          or proportion of times an outcome occurs after <m>n</m> repetitions,
          stabilizes around the true probability as <m>n</m> gets large.

          The probability of an event and the probability of its
          <term>complement</term> add up to 1.
          Sometime we use <m>P(A) = 1- P(\text{ not } A)</m> when
          <m>P(\text{ not } A)</m> is easier to calculate than <m>P(A)</m>.

      <li>
        <p>
          <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>disjoint</term>, i.e.
          <term>mutually exclusive</term>,
          if they cannot happen together.
          In this case,
          the events do not overlap and <m>P(A \text { and } B) = 0</m>.

      <li>

      <li>
        <p>
          When <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are not disjoint,
          adding <m>P(A)</m> and <m>P(B)</m> will overestimate
          <m>P(A \text{ or } B)</m> because the overlap of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> will be added twice.
          Therefore, when <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are not disjoint,
          use the <term>General Addition Rule</term>:
          <m>P(A \text{ or B } ) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)</m>.<fn>
          Often written: <m>P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)</m>.

        <p>
          To find the probability that <em>at least one</em>
          of several events occurs,
          use a special case of the rule of
          <em>complements</em><idx><h>rule of complements|textbf</h></idx>
          :
            <idx><h>complement</h></idx>

      <li>
        <p>
          When only considering two events,
          the probability that one <em>or</em>
          the other happens is equal to the probability that <em>at least one</em>
          of the two events happens.
          When dealing with more than two events,
          the General Addition Rule becomes very complicated.
          Instead, to find the probability that <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> or <m>C</m> occurs,
          find the probability that none of them occur and subtract that value from 1.

        <p>
          Two events are <term>independent</term>

          Players win by removing all of their pieces from the board,
