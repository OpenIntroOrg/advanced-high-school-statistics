      <title>Prop 19 in California</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In a 2010 Survey USA poll, 70% of the 119 respondents between the ages of 18 and 34 said they would vote in the 2010 general election for Prop 19,
          which would change California law to legalize marijuana and allow it to be regulated and taxed.
          At a 95% confidence level, this sample has an 8% margin of error.
          Based on this information,

        <p>
          In July 2008 the US National Institutes of Health announced that it was stopping a clinical study early because of unexpected results.
          The study population consisted of HIV-infected women in sub-Saharan Africa who had been given single dose Nevaripine (a treatment for HIV) while giving birth,
          to prevent transmission of HIV to the infant.
          The study was a randomized comparison of continued treatment of a woman
          (after successful childbirth)
          with Nevaripine vs.
          Lopinavir, a second drug used to treat HIV. 240 women participated in the study; 120 were randomized to each of the two treatments.
          Twenty-four weeks after starting the study treatment,
          each woman was tested to determine if the HIV infection was becoming worse
          (an outcome called <em>virologic failure</em>).
          Twenty-six of the 120 women treated with Nevaripine experienced virologic failure,
          while 10 of the 120 women treated with the other drug experienced virologic failure. \footfullcite{Lockman:2007}

        <p>
          A 2012 Gallup poll surveyed Americans about their employment status and whether or not they have diabetes.
          The survey results indicate that 1.5% of the 47,774 employed
          (full or part time)
          and 2.5% of the 5,855 unemployed 18-29 year olds have diabetes.\footfullcite{data:employmentDiabetes}

                The sample difference is about 1%. If we completed the hypothesis test,
                we would find that the p-value is very small (about 0),
                meaning the difference is statistically significant.
                Use this result to explain the difference between statistically significant and practically significant findings.

          The differences in each political group may be due to chance.
          Complete the following computations under the null hypothesis of independence between an individual's party affiliation and his support of full-body scans.
          It may be useful to first add on an extra column for row totals before proceeding with the computations.

      <title>Coffee and Depression</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Researchers conducted a study investigating the relationship between caffeinated coffee consumption and risk of depression in women.
          They collected data on 50,739 women free of depression symptoms at the start of the study in the year 1996,
          and these women were followed through 2006.
          The researchers used questionnaires to collect data on caffeinated coffee consumption,
          asked each individual about physician-diagnosed depression,
          and also asked about the use of antidepressants.
          The table below shows the distribution of incidences of depression by amount of caffeinated coffee consumption.\footfullcite{Lucas:2011}

              Make sure to clearly state the hypotheses, check conditions,
              calculate the appropriate test statistic and the p-value,
              and make your conclusion in context of the data.
              Also comment on what your conclusion says about whether or not this sample can be considered to be representative.

              Region and direction:
              <ol type="i">
                <li>
                  <p>
                    We would like to evaluate the relationship between region and feeling about the country's direction.
                    What is the response variable and what is the explanatory variable?

                <li>
                  <p>
                    What are the hypotheses for evaluating this relationship?
