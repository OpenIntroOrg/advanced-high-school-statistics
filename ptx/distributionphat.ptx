  <title>Sampling distribution of a sample proportion</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Often, instead of the number of successes in <m>n</m> trials,
      we are interested in the <em>proportion</em>
      of successes in <m>n</m> trials.
      We can use the sampling distribution of a sample proportion to answer questions such as the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Given a population that is 50% male,
            what is the probability that a random sample of 200 people would consist of less than 45% males?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In a particular state, 48% support a controversial measure.
            When estimating the percent through polling,
            what is the probability that a random sample of size 200 will mistakenly estimate the percent support to be greater than 50%?

    <title>The mean and standard deviation of <m>\hat{p}</m></title>
    <p>
      To answer these questions,
      we investigate the distribution of the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m>.
      In the last section we saw that the <em>number</em>
      of people with blood type O+ in a random sample of size 40 follows a binomial distribution with <m>n=40</m> and <m>p=0.35</m> that is centered on 14 and has standard deviation 3.0.
      What does the distribution of the <em>proportion</em>
      of people with blood type O+ in a sample of size 40 look like?
      To convert from a count to a proportion,
      we divide the count (i.e.<nbsp/>number of<nbsp/>yeses) by the sample size,
      <m>n = 40</m>.
      For example, 6 becomes <m>8/40 = 0.20</m> as a proportion and 11 becomes <m>11/40 = 0.275</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can find the general formula for the mean
      (expected value)
      and standard deviation of a sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> using our tools that we've learned so far.
      To get the sample mean for <m>\hat{p}</m>,
      we divide the binomial mean <m>\mu_{binomial} = np</m> by <m>n</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>\mu_{\hat{p}} = \frac{\mu_{binomial}}{n} = \frac{np}{n} = p</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      As one might expect,
      the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> is centered on the true proportion <m>p</m>.
      Likewise, the standard deviation of <m>\hat{p}</m> is equal to the standard deviation of the binomial distribution divided by <m>n</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \frac{\sigma_{binomial}}{n} = \frac{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}{n} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title></title>
      <p>
        The mean and standard deviation of the sample proportion describe the center and spread of the distribution of all possible sample proportions <m>\hat{p}</m> from a random sample of size <m>n</m> with true population proportion <m>p</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>\mu_{\hat{p}} \amp = p \amp  \sigma_{\hat{p}}\amp = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \vspace{1mm}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      In analyses,
      we think of the formula for the standard deviation of a sample proportion,
      <m>\sigma_{\hat{p}}</m>,
      as describing the uncertainty associated with the estimate <m>\hat{p}</m>.
      That is, <m>\sigma_{\hat{p}}</m> can be thought of as a way to quantify the typical error
          <idx><h>error|textbf</h></idx>
      in our sample estimate <m>\hat{p}</m> of the true proportion <m>p</m>.
      Understanding the variability of statistics such as <m>\hat{p}</m> is a central component in the study of statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, <m>n=40</m> and <m>p=0.35</m>,
      <m>\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.35(1-0.35)}{40}}=0.075</m>.
      We see in <xref ref="oPositive40prop">Figure</xref>
      that the distribution of number of people in a sample with blood type O+ out of 40 is equivalent to the distribution of proportion of people in a sample of size 40 with blood type O+, but with a change of scale.
      Instead of counts along the horizontal axis, we have proportions.
    </p>

    <title>The Central Limit Theorem revisited</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="distributionofxbar">section</xref>,
      we saw the Central Limit Theorem,
      which states that for large enough <m>n</m>,
      the sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m> is normally distributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A natural question is, what does this have to do with sample proportions?
      In<nbsp/>fact, a<nbsp/>lot!
      A sample proportion can be written down as a sample mean.
      For example, suppose we have 3 successes in 10 trials.
      If we label each of the 3 success as a 1 and each of the 7 failures as a 0, then the sample proportion is the same as the sample mean:
      <md>
        <mrow>\hat{p} = \frac{1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0}{10} = \frac{3}{10} = 0.3</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      That is, the distribution of the sample proportion is governed by the Central Limit Theorem,
      and the Central Limit Theorem is what ties together much of the statistical theory we will see.

      The binomial distribution shows the distribution of the number of successes in <m>n</m> trials.

      Cases 1 and 2 apply to <term>numerical</term> variables,
      while cases 3 and 4 are for <term>categorical</term> yes/no variables.

      Note that in the binomial case and in the case of proportions,
      we never look to see if the <em>population</em> is normal.
      That would not make sense because the
      <q>population</q>
      is simply a bunch of no/yes, 0/1 values and could not possibly be normal.

    <p>
      The <term>Central Limit Theorem</term>
      is the mathematical rule that ensures that when the sample size is sufficiently large,
      the sample mean/sum and sample proportion/count will be approximately normal.
