      What are the different ways to measure the center of a distribution,
      and why is there more than one way to measure the center?
      How do you know if a value is
      <q>far</q>
      from the center?
      What does it mean to an outlier?
      We will continue with the <c>email50</c> data set and investigate multiple quantitative summarizes for numerical data.

    <title>Measures of center</title>
    <p>
      In the previous section,
      we saw that modes can occur anywhere in a data set.
      Therefore, mode is not a measure of <term>center</term>.
      We understand the term <em>center</em> intuitively,
      but quantifying what is the center can be a little more challenging.
      This is because there are different definitions of center.
      Here we will focus on the two most common: the mean and median.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <term>mean</term>, sometimes called the average,
          <idx><h>mean</h><h>average</h></idx>
      is a common way to measure the center of a distribution of data.
      To find the mean number of characters in the 50 emails,
      we add up all the character counts and divide by the number of emails.
      For computational convenience,
      the number of characters is listed in the thousands and rounded to the first decimal.
      <md>
        <mrow>\bar{x} = \frac{21.7 + 7.0 + \cdots + 15.8}{50} = 11.6</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The sample mean is often labeled <m>\bar{x}</m>.
      The letter <m>x</m> is being used as a generic placeholder for the variable of interest, <c>num_char</c>,
      and the bar on the <m>x</m> communicates that the average number of characters in the 50 emails was 11,600.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title></title>
      <p>
        The sample mean of a numerical variable is computed as the sum of all of the observations divided by the number of observations:
        <md>
          <mrow>\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum{x_{i}} = \frac{\sum{x_i}}{n}=\frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}{n}</mrow>
        </md>
        where <m>\sum</m> is the capital Greek letter sigma and
        <m>\sum{x_{i}}</m> means take the sum of all the individual <m>x</m> values.
        <m>x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n</m> represent the <m>n</m> observed values.

    <p>
      The <c>email50</c> data set represents a sample from a larger population of emails that were received in January and March.
      We could compute a mean for this population in the same way as the sample mean, however,
      the population mean has a special label: <m>\mu</m>.
          <idx><h>Greek</h><h>mu@mu (<m>\mu</m>)</h></idx>
      The symbol <m>\mu</m> is the Greek letter <em>mu</em>
      and represents the average of all observations in the population.
      Sometimes a subscript, such as <m>_x</m>,
      is used to represent which variable the population mean refers to, e.g.
      <m>\mu_x</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          The average number of characters across all emails can be estimated using the sample data.
          Based on the sample of 50 emails,
          what would be a reasonable estimate of <m>\mu_x</m>,
          the mean number of characters in all emails in the <c>email</c> data set? (Recall that <c>email50</c> is a sample from <c>email</c>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The sample mean, 11,600, may provide a reasonable estimate of <m>\mu_x</m>.
          While this number will not be perfect,
          it provides a <em>point estimate</em> of the population mean.
          In <xref ref="foundationsForInference">Chapter</xref> and beyond,
          we will develop tools to characterize the reliability of point estimates,
          and we will find that point estimates based on larger samples tend to be more reliable than those based on smaller samples.

      <statement>
        <p>
          We might like to compute the average income per person in the US. To do so,
          we might first think to take the mean of the per capita incomes across the 3,142 counties in the <c>county</c> data set.
          What would be a better approach?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The <c>county</c> data set is special in that each county actually represents many individual people.
          If we were to simply average across the <c>income</c> variable,
          we would be treating counties with 5,000 and 5,000,000 residents equally in the calculations.
          Instead, we should compute the total income for each county,
          add up all the counties' totals,
          and then divide by the number of people in all the counties.
          If we completed these steps with the <c>county</c> data,
          we would find that the per capita income for the US is $27,348.43.
          Had we computed the <em>simple</em>
          mean of per capita income across counties,
          the result would have been just $22,504.70!

      The median provides another measure of center.
      The <term>median</term> splits an ordered data set in half.
      There are 50 character counts in the <c>email50</c> data set
      (an even number)
      so the data are perfectly split into two groups of<nbsp/>25.
      We take the median in this case to be the average of the two middle observations:
      <m>(\text{ 6,768 } + \text{ 7,012 } ) / 2 = \text{ 6,890 }</m>.
      When there are an odd number of observations,
      there will be exactly one observation that splits the data into two halves,
      and in this case that observation is the median
      (no average needed).

      <p>
        In an ordered data set, the <term>median</term>
        is the observation right in the middle.
        If there are an even number of observations,
        the median is the average of the two middle values.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      Graphically, we can think of the mean as the balancing point.
      The median is the value such that 50% of the <em>area</em>
      is to the left of it and 50% of the
      <em>area</em> is to the right of it.

    <title>Standard deviation as a measure of spread</title>
    <p>
      The U.S. Census Bureau reported that in 2017,
      the median family income was $73,891 and the mean family income was $99,114.<fn>
      MISSINGoiRedirect
      </fn> Is a family income of $60,000 far from the mean or somewhat close to the mean?
      In order to answer this question,
      it is not enough to know the center of the data set and its <term>range</term>
      (maximum value - minimum value).
      We must know about the variability
          <idx><h>variability</h></idx>
      of the data set within that range.
      Low variability or small spread means that the values tend to be more clustered together.
      High variability or large spread means that the values tend to be far apart.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Is it possible for two data sets to have the same range but different spread?

      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Here, we introduce the standard deviation as a measure of spread.
      Though its formula is a bit tedious to calculate by hand,
      the standard deviation is very useful in data analysis and roughly describes how far away,
      on average,
      the observations are from the mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      We call the distance of an observation from its mean its <term>deviation</term>.
      Below are the deviations for the <m>1^{st}_{}</m>,
      <m>2^{nd}_{}</m>, <m>3^{rd}</m>,
      and <m>50^{th}_{}</m> observations in the <c>num_char</c> variable.
      For computational convenience,
      the number of characters is listed in the thousands and rounded to the first decimal.

      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we square these deviations and then take an average,
      the result is about equal to the sample <term>variance</term>,
      denoted by <m>s_{}^2</m>:
      <md>

      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We divide by <m>n-1</m>,
      rather than dividing by <m>n</m>,
      when computing the variance;
      you need not worry about this mathematical nuance for the material in this textbook.
      Notice that squaring the deviations does two things.
      First, it makes large values much larger,
      seen by comparing <m>10.1^2</m>,
      <m>(-4.6)^2</m>, <m>(-11.0)^2</m>, and <m>4.2^2</m>.
      Second, it gets rid of any negative signs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <term>standard deviation</term>
      is defined as the square root of the variance:
      <me>
        s=\sqrt{172.44} = 13.13
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard deviation of the number of characters in an email is about 13.13 thousand.
      A subscript of <m>_x</m> may be added to the variance and standard deviation, i.e.
      <m>s_x^2</m> and <m>s_x^{}</m>,
      as a reminder that these are the variance and standard deviation of the observations represented by <m>x_1^{}</m>,
      <m>x_2^{}</m>, ..., <m>x_n^{}</m>.
      The <m>_{x}</m> subscript is usually omitted when it is clear which data the variance or standard deviation is referencing.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title></title>
      <p>
        The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
        It is roughly the
        <q>typical</q>
        distance of the observations from the mean.

    </assemblage>
    <p>
      The variance is useful for mathematical reasons,
      but the standard deviation is easier to interpret because it has the same units as the data set.
      The units for variance will be the units squared (e.g. meters<m>^2</m>).
      Formulas and methods used to compute the variance and standard deviation for a population are similar to those used for a sample.<fn>
      The only difference is that the population variance has a division by <m>n</m> instead of <m>n-1</m>.
      </fn> However,
      like the mean, the population values have special symbols:
      <m>\sigma_{}^2</m> for the variance and <m>\sigma</m> for the standard deviation.
      The symbol <m>\sigma</m> <idx><h>Greek</h><h>sigma@sigma (<m>\sigma</m>)</h></idx> is the Greek letter <em>sigma</em>.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title></title>
      <p>
        It is useful to think of the standard deviation as the
        <q>typical</q>
        or
        <q>average</q>
        distance that observations fall from the mean.

      In Chapter<nbsp/>4, we encounter a bell-shaped distribution known as the
      <em>normal distribution</em>.
      The <term>empirical rule</term> tells us that for normal distributions,
      about 68% of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean,
      about 95% will be within two standard deviations of the mean,
      and about 99.7% will be within three standard deviations of the mean.
      However, as seen in <xref ref="emailCharactersDotPlotStackedRoundedWithSD">Figures</xref>

      Knowing how many standard deviations a value is from the mean is often more useful than simply knowing how far a value is from the mean.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider that the mean family income in the U.S. in 2017 was $99,114.
          Let's round this to $100,000 and estimate the standard deviation of income as $50,000.
          Using these estimates,
          how many standard deviations above the mean is an income of $200,000?

      The number of standard deviations a value is above or below the mean is known as the <term>Z-score</term>.
          <idx><h>Z@<m>Z</m></h></idx>
      A Z-score has no units, and therefore is sometimes also called
      <em>standard units</em>.

      <p>
        The Z-score of an observation is the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean.
        We compute the Z-score for an observation <m>x</m> that follows a distribution with mean <m>\mu</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma</m> using
        <md>
          <mrow>Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      Observations above the mean always have positive Z-scores,
      while those below the mean always have negative Z-scores.
      If an observation is equal to the mean,
      then the Z-score is <m>0</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Head lengths of brushtail possums have a mean of 92.6 mm and standard deviation 3.6 mm.
          Compute the Z-scores for possums with head lengths of 95.4 mm and 85.8<nbsp/>mm.

    <p>
      We can use Z-scores to roughly identify which observations are more unusual than others.
      An observation <m>x_1</m> is said to be more unusual than another observation <m>x_2</m> if the absolute value of its Z-score is larger than the absolute value of the other observation's Z-score:
      <m>|Z_1| > |Z_2|</m>.
      This technique is especially insightful when a distribution is symmetric.

      Because Z-scores have no units,
      they are useful for comparing distance to the mean for distributions that have different standard deviations or different units.

          The average daily high temperature in June in LA is 77^\circ F with a standard deviation of 5^\circF. The average daily high temperature in June in Iceland is 13^\circC with a standard deviation of 3^\circC. Which would be considered more unusual:
          an 83^\circF day in June in LA or a 19^\circC day in June in Iceland?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Both values are 6^\circ above the mean.
          However, they are not the same number of standard deviations above the mean. 83 is
          <m>(83-77)/5 = 1.2</m> standard deviations above the mean,
          while 19 is <m>(19-13)/3 = 2</m> standard deviations above the mean.
          Therefore, a 19^\circC day in June in Iceland would be more unusual than an 83^\circF day in June in LA.

    <title>Box plots and quartiles</title>
    <p>
      A <term>box plot</term> summarizes a data set using five summary statistics while also plotting unusual observations,
      called outliers.
          <idx><h>outlier|textbf</h></idx>
      <xref ref="boxPlotLayoutNumVar">Figure</xref>
      provides a box plot of the <c>num_char</c> variable from the <c>email50</c> data set.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="boxPlotLayoutNumVar">

      MISSINGoiRedirect
    </figure>
    <p>
      The five summary statistics used in a box plot are known as the
      <term>five-number summary</term>,
      which consists of the minimum, the maximum,
      and the three quartiles (<m>Q_1</m>,
      <m>Q_2</m>, <m>Q_3</m>) of the data set being studied.
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>Q_2</m>
          <idx><h>quantile 2@Q<m>_2</m></h></idx>
      represents the <term>second quartile</term>,
      which is equivalent to the 50th percentile (i.e. the median).
      Previously, we saw that Q<m>_2</m>
      (the median)
      for the <c>email50</c> data set was the average of the two middle values:
      <m>\frac{\text{ 6,768 } + \text{ 7,012 } }{2} = \text{ 6,890 }</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>Q_1</m>
          <idx><h>quantile 1@Q<m>_1</m></h></idx>
      represents the <term>first quartile</term>,
      which is the 25th percentile,
      and is the median of the smaller half of the data set.
      There are 25 values in the lower half of the data set,
      so <m>Q_1</m> is the middle value: 2,454 characters.
      <m>Q_3</m>
          <idx><h>quantile 3@<m>Q_3</m></h></idx>
      represents the <term>third quartile</term>, or 75th percentile,
      and is the median of the larger half of the data set: 15,829 characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      We calculate the variability in the data using the range of the middle 50% of the data:
      <m>Q_3 - Q_1 = \text{ 13,375 }</m>.
      This quantity is called the <em>interquartile range</em><idx><h>interquartile range (IQR)|textbf</h></idx> (IQR, for short).
      It, like the standard deviation,
      is a measure of variability
          <idx><h>variability</h></idx>
      or <term>spread</term> in data.
      The more variable the data,
      the larger the standard deviation and<nbsp/>IQR tend to be.

    <assemblage>
      <title></title>
      <p>
        The IQR<idx><h>interquartile range (IQR)</h></idx> is the length of the box in a box plot.
        It is computed as
        <md>
          <mrow>IQR = Q_3 - Q_1</mrow>
        </md>
        where <m>Q_1</m> and <m>Q_3</m> are the <m>25^{th}</m> and <m>75^{th}</m> percentiles.

      <title></title>
      <p>
        When in the context of a box plot,
        define an <term>outlier</term> as an \mbox{observation} that is more than
        <m>1.5 \times IQR</m> above <m>Q_3</m> or <m>1.5 \times IQR</m> below <m>Q_1</m>.
        Such points are marked using a dot or asterisk in a box plot.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      To build a box plot, draw an axis
      (vertical or horizontal)
      and draw a scale.
      Draw a dark line denoting <m>Q_2</m>, the median.
      Next, draw a line at <m>Q_1</m> and at <m>Q_3</m>.
      Connect the <m>Q_1</m> and <m>Q_3</m> lines to form a rectangle.
      The width of the rectangle corresponds to the IQR and the middle 50% of the data is in this interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extending out from the rectangle,
      the <term>whiskers</term> attempt to capture all of the data remaining outside of the box,
      except outliers.
      In <xref ref="boxPlotLayoutNumVar">Figure</xref>,
      the upper whisker does not extend to the last three points,
      which are beyond <m>Q_3 + 1.5\times IQR</m> and are outliers,
      so it extends only to the last point below this limit.<fn>
      You might wonder, isn't the choice of
      <m>1.5 \times IQR</m> for defining an outlier arbitrary?
      It is!
      In practical data analyses,
      we tend to avoid a strict definition since what is an unusual observation is highly dependent on the context of the data.
      </fn> The lower whisker stops at the lowest value, 33,
      since there are no additional data to reach.
      Outliers are each marked with a dot or asterisk.
      In a sense, the box is like the body of the box plot and the whiskers are like its arms trying to reach the rest of the data.

          Find the 5 number summary and identify how small or large a value would need to be to be considered an outlier.
          Are there any outliers in this data set?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          There are nine numbers in this data set.
          Because <m>n</m> is odd, the median is the middle number: 15.
          When finding <m>Q_1</m>,
          we find the median of the lower half of the data,
          which in this case includes 4 numbers
          (we do not include the 15 as belonging to either half of the data set).
          <m>Q_1</m> then is the average of 5 and 9, which is <m>Q_1 = 7</m>,
          and <m>Q_3</m> is the average of 20 and 30, so <m>Q_3 = 25</m>.
          The min is 5 and the max is 80.
          To see how small a number needs to be to be an outlier on the low end we do:
          <md>
            <mrow>Q_1 - 1.5 \times IQR \amp = Q_1 - 1.5 \times (Q_3 - Q_1)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = 7 - 1.5 \times (35 - 7)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = -35</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          On the high end we need:
          <md>
            <mrow>Q_3 + 1.5 \times IQR \amp  = Q_3 + 1.5 \times (Q_3-Q_1)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = 35 + 1.5 \times (35 - 7)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = 77</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no numbers less than -41,
          so there are no outliers on the low end.
          The observation at 80 is greater than 77,
          so 80 is an outlier on the high end.

          <li>
            <p>
              More than 1.5<times/> IQR below <m>Q_1</m> or above <m>Q_3</m>

    <p>
      The median and IQR are called <term>robust estimates</term>

          The new list: {10, 10, 50, 50} has a mean of 30 with a standard deviation of 20.

          The new list: {-0.5, -0.5, -2.5, -2.5} has a mean of -1.5 with a standard deviation of<nbsp/>1.
          Because all of the values were multiplied by<nbsp/>\mbox{-0.5} , the mean was multiplied by<nbsp/>\mbox{-0.5} . Multiplying all of the values by a negative flipped the sign of numbers,
          which affects the location of the center, but not the spread.
          Multiplying all of the values by \mbox{-0.5} multiplied the standard deviation by +0.5 since the standard deviation cannot be negative.

          Adding a constant to every entry shifted the values, but did not stretch them.

      </answer>
    </example>
    <p>
      Suppose that a researcher is looking at a list of 500 temperatures recorded in Celsius<nbsp/>(C).
      The mean of the temperatures listed is given as 27^\circ C with a standard deviation of 3^\circ C. Because she is not familiar with the Celsius scale,
      she would like to convert these summary statistics into Fahrenheit<nbsp/>(F).
      To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit,
      we use the following conversion:
      <md>
        <mrow>x_{_F} = \frac{9}{5}x_{_C} + 32</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately,
      she does not need to convert each of the 500 temperatures to Fahrenheit and then recalculate the mean and the standard deviation.
      The unit conversion above is a linear transformation of the following form,
      where <m>a=9/5</m> and <m>b=32</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>aX + b</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the examples as a guide,
      we can solve this temperature-conversion problem.
      The mean was 27^\circ C and the standard deviation was 3^\circ C. To convert to Fahrenheit,
      we multiply all of the values by <m>9/5</m>,
      which multiplies both the mean and the standard deviation by <m>9/5</m>.
      Then we add 32 to all of the values which adds 32 to the mean but does not change the standard deviation further.
      <md>
        <mrow>\bar{x}_{F} \amp = \frac{9}{5}\bar{x}_{C} + 32 \amp  \sigma_{F} \amp = \frac{9}{5}\sigma_{C}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{5}{9}(27)+ 32 \amp  \amp =\frac{9}{5}(3)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =80.6 \amp   \amp =5.4</mrow>

        Adding a constant to every value in a data set shifts the mean but does not affect the standard deviation.
        Multiplying the values in a data set by a constant will change the mean and the standard deviation by the same multiple,

    <title>Comparing numerical data across groups</title>

    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the more interesting investigations can be considered by examining numerical data across groups.
      The methods required here aren't really new.
      All that is required is to make a numerical plot for each group.
      To make a direct comparison between two groups,
      create a pair of dot plots or a pair of histograms drawn using the same scales.
      It is also common to use back-to-back stem-and-leaf plots,
      parallel box plots, and hollow histograms,
      the three of which are explored here.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will take a look again at the <c>county</c> data set and compare the median household income for counties that gained population from 2010 to 2017 versus counties that had no gain.
      While we might like to make a causal connection here,
      remember that these are observational data and so such an interpretation would be, at best,
      half-baked.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were 1,454 counties where the population increased from 2010 to 2017,
      and there were 1,672 counties with no gain
      (all but one were a loss).
      A<nbsp/>random sample of 100 counties from the first group and 50 from the second group are shown in <xref ref="countyIncomeSplitByPopGainTable">Figure</xref>
      to give a better sense of some of the raw median income data.

      from a random sample of 100 counties that had population
      gains are shown on the left.

    <p>
      Looking at an association is different than comparing distributions.
      When comparing distributions,
      we are interested in questions such as,
      <q>Which distribution has a greater average?</q>
      and
      <q>How do the shapes of the distribution differ?</q>
      The number of elements in each data set need not be the same (e.g. height of women and height of men).
      When we look at association,
      we are interested in whether there is a positive, negative,
      or no association between the variables.
      This requires two data sets of equal length that are essentially paired (e.g. height and weight of individuals).

        We compare two distributions with respect to center, spread,

        To compare the distributions visually,
        we use 2 single-variable graphs,
        such as two histograms, two dot plots,
        parallel box plots, or a back-to-back stem-and-leaf.
        When looking at association,
        we look for a positive, negative,
        or no relationship between the variables.
        To see association visually, we require a scatterplot.

      The <c>county</c> data set offers many numerical variables that we could plot using dot plots,
      scatterplots,
      or box plots, but these miss the true nature of the data.
      Rather, when we encounter geographic data,
      we should create an <term>intensity map</term>,
      where colors are used to show higher and lower values of a variable.
      <xref ref="countyIntensityMaps1">Figures</xref>
      and <xref ref="countyIntensityMaps2"></xref>
      shows intensity maps for poverty rate in percent (<c>poverty</c>), unemployment rate (<c>unemployment\usrate</c>), homeownership rate in percent (<c>homeownership</c>), and median household income (<c>median\ushh\usincome</c>).
      The color key indicates which colors correspond to which values.
      The intensity maps are not generally very helpful for getting precise values in any given county,
      but they are very helpful for seeing geographic trends and generating interesting research questions or hypotheses.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What interesting features are evident in the <c>poverty</c> and <c>unemployment\usrate</c> intensity maps?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Poverty rates are evidently higher in a few locations.
          Notably, the deep south shows higher poverty rates,
          as does much of Arizona and New Mexico.
          High poverty rates are evident in the Mississippi flood plains a little north of New Orleans and also in a large section of Kentucky.
        </p>
        <p>
          The unemployment rate follows similar trends,
          and we can see correspondence between the two variables.
          In fact, it makes sense for higher rates of unemployment to be closely related to poverty rates.
          One observation that stand out when comparing the two maps:
          the poverty rate is much higher than the unemployment rate,
          meaning while many people may be working,
          they are not making enough to break out of poverty.

          the mean is greater than the median.
          Analogously, in a <term>left skewed</term> distribution,

          Two rules of thumb for identifying observations as outliers are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                more than 2 standard deviations above or below the mean

            <li>
              <p>
                more than <m>1.5 \times IQR</m> below <m>Q_1</m> or above <m>Q_3</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        Note: These rules of thumb generally produce different cutoffs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Mean and SD are sensitive to outliers.
          Median and IQR are more robust and less sensitive to outliers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>empirical rule</term> states that for normal distributions,
          about 68% of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean,
          about 95% will be within two standard deviations of the mean,
          and about 99.7% will be within three standard deviations of the mean.

          <em>Linear transformations of data</em>.
            <idx><h>linear transformations of data|textbf</h></idx>
        Adding a constant to every value in a data set shifts the mean but does not affect the standard deviation.
          Multiplying the values in a data set by a constant will multiply the mean and the standard deviation by that constant,
          except that the standard deviation must always remain positive.
        </p>

          <em>Box plots</em>

          do not show the <em>distribution</em>
          of a data set in the way that histograms do.
          Rather, they provide a visual depiction of the
          <term>5-number summary</term>, which consists of:
          <m>min</m>, <m>Q_1</m>, <m>Q_2</m>, <m>Q_3</m>, <m>max</m>.

          Daily air quality is measured by the air quality index (AQI) reported by the Environmental Protection Agency.
          This index reports the pollution level and what associated health effects might be a concern.
          The index is calculated for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act and takes values from 0 to 300,
