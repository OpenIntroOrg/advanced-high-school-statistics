      What is the probability of exactly 50 heads in 100 coin tosses?
      Or the probability of randomly sampling 8 people and having exactly 1 of them be left-handed?
      Or of at most 3<nbsp/>people exceeding their insurance deductible in a random sample of 20 people?
      The binomial formula can help us answer these questions.

    <title>Introducing the binomial formula</title>
    <p>
      Many health insurance plans in the United States have a deductible,
      where the insured individual is responsible for costs up to the deductible,
      and then the costs above the deductible are shared between the individual and insurance company for the remainder of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose a health insurance company found that 70% of the people they insure stay below their deductible in any given year.
      Each of these people can be thought of as a <term>trial</term>.
      We label a person a <term>success</term>
      if her healthcare costs do not exceed the deductible.
      We label a person a <term>failure</term>
      if she does exceed her deductible in the year.
      Because 70% of the individuals will not hit their deductible,
      we denote the <term>probability of a success</term>
      as <m>p = \insureSprob{}</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose the insurance agency is considering a random sample of four individuals they insure.
          What is the chance exactly one of them will exceed the deductible and the other three will not?
          Let's call the four people Ariana (<m>A</m>), Brittany (<m>B</m>), Carlton (<m>C</m>),
          and Damian (<m>D</m>) for convenience.

    <p>
      The binomial distribution describes the probability of having exactly <m>x</m> successes in <m>n</m> independent trials with probability of a success <m>p</m>
      (in <xref ref="insureOneOfFourExceedsDeductible">Example</xref>,
      <m>n=4</m>,
      <m>x=3</m>, <m>p=\insureSprob{}</m>).
      We would like to determine the probabilities associated with the binomial distribution more generally,
      i.e. we want a formula where we can use <m>n</m>, <m>x</m>,
      and <m>p</m> to obtain the probability.
      To do this, we reexamine each part of <xref ref="insureOneOfFourExceedsDeductible">Example</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were four individuals who could have been the one to exceed the deductible,
      and each of these four scenarios had the same probability.
      Thus, we could identify the final probability as
      <md>
        <mrow>\times P(\text{ single scenario } )</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first component of this equation is the number of ways to arrange the <m>x=3</m> successes among the <m>n=4</m> trials.
      The second component is the probability of any of the four
      (equally probable)
      scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider <m>P(</m>single scenario<m>)</m> under the general case of <m>x</m> successes and <m>n-x</m> failures in the <m>n</m> trials.
      In any such scenario,
      we apply the Multiplication Rule for independent events:
      <md>
        <mrow>p^x (1 - p)^{n - x}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is our general formula for <m>P(</m>single scenario<m>)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, we introduce the <term>binomial coefficient</term>,
      which gives the number of ways to choose <m>x</m> successes in <m>n</m> trials,
      i.e. arrange <m>x</m> successes and <m>n - x</m> failures:
      <md>
        <mrow>{n\choose x} = \frac{n!}{x! (n - x)!}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The quantity <m>{n\choose x}</m> is read
      <term>n choose x</term>.<fn>
      Other notations for <m>n</m> choose <m>x</m> includes <m>_nC_x</m>,
      <m>C_n^x</m>, and <m>C(n,x)</m>.
      </fn> The exclamation point notation (e.g.
      <m>n!</m>) denotes a <term>factorial</term> expression.
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp  0! = 1</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  1! = 1</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  2! = 2\times1 = 2</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  3! = 3\times2\times1 = 6</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  4! = 4\times3\times2\times1 = 24</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  \vdots</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  n! = n\times(n-1)\times...\times3\times2\times1</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the formula,
      we can compute the number of ways to choose <m>x = 3</m> successes in <m>n = 4</m> trials:
      <md>
        <mrow>{4 \choose 3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4!}{3!1!} = \frac{4\times3\times2\times1}{(3\times2\times1) (1)} = 4</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This result is exactly what we found by carefully thinking of each possible scenario in <xref ref="insureOneOfFourExceedsDeductible">Example</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Substituting <m>n</m> choose <m>x</m> for the number of scenarios and
      <m>p^x(1-p)^{n-x}</m> for the single scenario probability yields the
      <term>binomial formula</term>.

        Suppose the probability of a single trial being a success is <m>p</m>.
        Then the probability of observing exactly <m>x</m> successes in <m>n</m> independent trials is given by
        <md>
          <mrow>P(X=x)={n\choose x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x} = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}</mrow>

          <m>n\choose x</m>, the <term>binomial coefficient</term>,
          describes the number of combinations for arranging <m>x</m> successes among <m>n</m> trials.
          <m>n\choose x</m> <m>=\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}</m>,
          where <m>n!=1\times 2\times 3\times...n</m>, and <m>0!</m>=0.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>binomial formula</term>
          can be used to find the probability that something happens
          <em>exactly x times in n trials</em>.
          Suppose the probability of a single trial being a success is <m>p</m>.
          Then the probability of observing exactly <m>x</m> successes in <m>n</m> independent trials is given by
          <md>
            <mrow>{n\choose x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}   =   \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}</mrow>

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To apply the binomial formula,
          the events must be <term>independent</term> from trial to trial.
          Additionally, <m>n</m>,
          the number of trials must be fixed in advance, and <m>p</m>,
          the probability of the event occurring in a given trial,
          must be the same for each trial.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To use the binomial formula,
          first confirm that the binomial conditions are met.
          Next, identify the number of trials <m>n</m>,
          the number of times the event is to be a
          <q>success</q>
          <m>x</m>, and the probability that a single trial is a success <m>p</m>.
          Finally, plug these three numbers into the formula to get the probability of exactly <m>x</m> successes in <m>n</m> trials.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <m>p^x(1-p)^{n-x}</m> part of the binomial formula is the probability of just one combination.
          Since there are <m>n\choose x</m> combinations,
          we add <m>p^x(1-p)^{n-x}</m> up <m>n\choose x</m> times.
          We can think of the binomial formula as:
          <m>[\# \text{ of combinations } ] \times P(\text{ a single combination } )</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To find a probability involving
          <em>at least</em> or <em>at most</em>,
          first determine if the scenario is binomial.
          If so, apply the binomial formula as many times as needed and add up the results. e.g.
          <m>P(\text{ at least 3 Heads in 5 tosses of a fair coin } )=P(\text{ exactly 3 Heads } )+P(\text{ exactly 4 Heads } )+P(\text{ exactly 5 Heads } )</m>,
          where each probability can be found using the binomial formula.
