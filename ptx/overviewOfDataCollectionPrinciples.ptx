      How do researchers collect data?
      Why are the results of some studies more reliable than others?
      The way a researcher collects data depends upon the research goals.
      In<nbsp/>this section,
      we look at different methods of collecting data and consider the types of conclusions that can be drawn from those methods.

    <title>Populations and samples</title>
    <p>
      Consider the following three research questions:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the average mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li xml:id="timeToGraduationQuestionForUCLAStudents">
          <p>
            Over the last 5 years,
            what is the average time to complete a degree for Duke undergrads?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li xml:id="identifyPopulationOfStentStudy">
          <p>
            Does a new drug reduce the number of deaths in patients with severe heart disease?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Each research question refers to a target <term>population</term>.
      In the first question,
      the target population is all swordfish in the Atlantic ocean,
      and each fish represents a case.
      Often times,
      it is too expensive to collect data for every case in a population.
      Instead, a sample is taken.
      A <term>sample</term> represents a subset of the cases and is often a small fraction of the population.
      For instance, 60 swordfish
      (or some other number)
      in the population might be selected,
      and this sample data may be used to provide an estimate of the population average and answer the research question.
    </p>
    <exercise xml:id="identifyingThePopulationForTwoQuestionsInPopAndSampSubsection">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For the second and third questions above,
          identify the target population and what represents an individual case.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      We collect a sample of data to better understand the characteristics of a population.
      A <term>variable</term> is a characteristic we measure for each individual or case.
      The overall quantity of interest may be the mean,
      median, proportion, or some other summary of a population.
      These population values are called <em>parameters</em>.
          <idx><h>parameter|textbf</h></idx>
      We estimate the value of a parameter by taking a sample and computing a numerical summary called a
      <term>statistic</term> based on that sample.
      Note that the two p's (population,
      parameter) go together and the two s's (sample, statistic) go together.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Earlier we asked the question:
          what is the average mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean?

          Earlier we asked the question:

    <p>
      Two statistics we will study are the <term>mean</term>
      (also called the <term>average</term>)
      and <term>proportion</term>.
      When we are discussing a population,
      we label the mean as <m>\mu</m>
      (the Greek letter, <em>mu</em>),
      while we label the sample mean as <m>\bar{x}</m>
      (read as <em>x-bar</em>).
      When we are discussing a proportion in the context of a population,
      we use the label <m>p</m>,
      while the sample proportion has a label of <m>\hat{p}</m>
      (read as <em>p-hat</em>).
      Generally, we use <m>\bar{x}</m> to estimate the population mean,
      <m>\mu</m>.
      Likewise, we use the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> to estimate the population proportion,
      <m>p</m>.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Is <m>\mu</m> a parameter or statistic?

        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          <m>\mu</m> is a parameter because it refers to the average of the
          <em>entire</em> population.
          <m>\hat{p}</m> is a statistic because it is calculated from a sample.

    <title>Anecdotal evidence</title>
    <p>
      Consider the following possible responses to the three research questions:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            A man on the news got mercury poisoning from eating swordfish,
            so the average mercury concentration in swordfish must be dangerously high.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li xml:id="iKnowThreeStudentsWhoTookMoreThan7YearsToGraduateAtDuke">
          <p>
            I met two students who took more than 7<nbsp/>years to graduate from Duke,
            so it must take longer to graduate at Duke than at many other colleges.

        <li xml:id="myFriendsDadDiedAfterSulphinpyrazon">

        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Each conclusion is based on data.
      However, there are two problems.
      First, the data only represent one or two cases.
      Second, and more importantly,
      it is unclear whether these cases are actually representative of the population.
      Data collected in this haphazard fashion are called
      <term>anecdotal evidence</term>.

      <p>
        Be careful of making inferences based on anecdotal evidence.
        Such evidence may be true and verifiable,
        but it may only represent extraordinary cases.
        The majority of cases and the average case may in fact be very different.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      Anecdotal evidence typically is composed of unusual cases that we recall based on their striking characteristics.
      For instance,
      we may vividly remember the time when our friend bought a lottery ticket and won $250 but forget most the times she bought one and lost.
      Instead of focusing on the most unusual cases,
      we should examine a representative sample of many cases.

    <title>Explanatory and response variables</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>data</h><h>county</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      When we ask questions about the relationship between two variables,
      we sometimes also want to determine if the change in one variable causes a change in the other.
      Consider the following rephrasing of an earlier question about the <c>county</c> data set:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      \em
      If there is an increase in the median household income
      in a county, does this drive an increase in its population?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In this question,
      we are asking whether one variable affects another.
      If this is our underlying belief,
      then <em>median household income</em>
      is the <em>explanatory</em><idx><h>explanatory variable|textbf</h></idx> variable and the
      <em>population change</em>
      is the <em>response</em><idx><h>response variable|textbf</h></idx> variable in the hypothesized relationship.<fn>
      Sometimes the explanatory variable is called the <term>independent</term>
      variable and the response variable is called the
      <term>dependent</term> variable.
      However, this becomes confusing since a <em>pair</em>
      of variables might be independent or dependent,
      so we avoid this language.
      </fn>
    </p>
    <p>
          <idx><h>data</h><h>county</h></idx>
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title></title>
      <p>
        When we suspect one variable might causally affect another,
        we label the first variable the explanatory variable and the second the response variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <image width="73%" source="images/expResp.png" />
      </p>
      <p>
        For many pairs of variables, there is no hypothesized relationship,
        and these labels would not be applied to either variable in such cases.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <assemblage>
      <title></title>
      <p>
        {Labeling variables as <em>explanatory</em> and <em>response</em>
        does not guarantee the relationship between the two is actually causal,
        even if there is an association identified between the two variables.
        We use these labels only to keep track of which variable we suspect affects the other.}
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      In many cases, the relationship is complex or unknown.
      It may be unclear whether variable <m>A</m> explains variable <m>B</m> or whether variable <m>B</m> explains variable <m>A</m>.
      For example,
      it is now known that a particular protein called REST is much depleted in people suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
      While this raises hopes of a possible approach for treating Alzheimer's, it is still unknown whether the lack of the protein causes brain deterioration,
      whether brain deterioration causes depletion in the REST protein,
      or whether some third variable causes both brain deterioration and REST depletion.
      That<nbsp/>is,
      we do not know if the lack of the protein is an explanatory variable or a response variable.
      Perhaps it is both.<fn>

    <title>Observational studies versus experiments</title>
    <p>
      There are two primary types of data collection:
      observational studies and experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Researchers perform an <term>observational study</term>
      when they collect data without interfering with how the data arise.
      For instance, researchers may collect information via surveys,
      review medical or company records,
      or follow a <term>cohort</term> of many similar individuals to study why certain diseases might develop.
      In each of these situations,
      researchers merely observe or take measurements of things that arise naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      When researchers want to investigate the possibility of a causal connection,
      they conduct an <term>experiment</term>.
      For all experiments, the researchers must impose a treatment.
      For most studies there will be both an explanatory and a response variable.
      For instance,
      we may suspect administering a drug will reduce mortality in heart attack patients over the following year.
      To check if there really is a causal connection between the explanatory variable and the response,
      researchers will collect a sample of individuals and split them into groups.
      The individuals in each group are
      <em>assigned</em> a treatment.
      When individuals are randomly assigned to a group,
      the experiment is called a <term>randomized experiment</term>.
      For example,
      each heart attack patient in the drug trial could be randomly assigned into one of two groups:
      the first group receives a <term>placebo</term>
      (fake treatment)
      and the second group receives the drug.
      See the case study in <xref ref="basicExampleOfStentsAndStrokes">Section</xref>
      for another example of an experiment,
      though that study did not employ a placebo.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that a researcher is interested in the average tip customers at a particular restaurant give.
          Should she carry out an observational study or an experiment?

          introduces a study on the relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior.
          As part of this study 129 University of California Berkeley undergraduates were asked to identify themselves as having low or high social-class by comparing themselves to others with the most (least) money,
          most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs.
          They were also presented with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby laboratory,
          but that they could take some if they wanted.
          After completing some unrelated tasks,
          participants reported the number of candies they had taken.
          It was found that those who were identified as upper-class took more candy than others.

          The General Social Survey asked the question, ``After an average work day,
          about how many hours do you have to relax or pursue activities that you enjoy?" to a random sample of 1,155 Americans.
          The average relaxing time was found to be 1.65 hours.

          Suppose you want to estimate the percentage of videos on YouTube that are cat videos.
          It is impossible for you to watch all videos on YouTube so you use a random video picker to select 1000 videos for you.
          You find that 2% of these videos are cat videos.Determine which of the following is an observation,
          a variable, a sample statistic
