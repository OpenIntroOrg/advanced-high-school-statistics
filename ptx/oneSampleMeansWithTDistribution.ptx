  <title>Inference for a mean with the <m>t</m>-distribution</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we turn our attention to numerical variables and answer questions such as the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            How well can we estimate the mean income of people in a certain city, county,
            or state?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the average mercury content in various types of fish?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Are people's run times getting faster or slower, on average?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            How does the sample size affect the expected error in our estimates?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When is it reasonable to model the sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m> using a normal distribution,
            and when will we need to use a new distribution,
            known as the <m>t</m>-distribution?

    <title>Using a normal distribution for inference when <m>\sigma</m> is known</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="distributionofxbar">Section</xref>
      we saw that the distribution of a sample mean is normal if the population is normal or if the sample size is at least 30.
      In these problems,
      we used the population mean and population standard deviation to find a Z-score.
      However, in the case of inference,
      these values will be unknown.
      In rare circumstances we may know the standard deviation of a population,
      even though we do not know its mean.
      For example, in some industrial processes,
      the mean may be known to shift over time,
      while the standard deviation of the process remains the same.
      In these cases,
      we can use the normal model as the basis for our inference procedures.
      We use <m>\bar{x}</m> as our point estimate for <m>\mu</m> and the <m>SD</m> formula for a sample mean calculated in <xref ref="distributionofxbar">Section</xref>:
      <m>\sigma_{\bar{x}} =\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</m>.
      That leads to a confidence interval and a test statistic as follows:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ CI:  }  \bar{x} \amp \ \pm \ z^{\star}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \amp \amp Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \text{ null value } }{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      What happens if we do not know the population standard deviation <m>\sigma</m>,
      as is usually the case?
      The best we can do is use the sample standard deviation,
      denoted by <m>s</m>, to estimate the population standard deviation.
      <md>
        <mrow>SE= \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when we do this we run into a problem:
      when carrying out our inference procedures,
      we will be trying to estimate <em>two</em> quantities:
      both the mean and the standard deviation.
      Looking at the <m>SD</m> and <m>SE</m> formulas,
      we can make some important observations that will give us a hint as to what will happen when we use <m>s</m> instead of <m>\sigma</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            For a given population, <m>\sigma</m> is a fixed number and does not vary.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>s</m>, the standard deviation of a sample,
            will vary from one sample to the next and will not be exactly equal to <m>\sigma</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The larger the sample size <m>n</m>,
            the better the estimate <m>s</m> will tend to be for <m>\sigma</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason,
      the normal model still works well when the sample size is large.
      For smaller sample sizes, we run into a problem:
      our use of <m>s</m>, which is used when computing the standard error,
      tends to add more variability to our test statistic.
      It is this extra variability that leads us to a new distribution:
      the \mbox{<m>t</m>-distribution} .
    </p>

    <title>Introducing the <m>t</m>-distribution</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>t-distribution@<m>t</m>-distribution</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      When we use the sample standard deviation <m>s</m> in place of the population standard deviation <m>\sigma</m> to standardize the sample mean,
      we get an entirely new distribution - one that is similar to the normal distribution,
      but has greater spread.
      This distribution is known as the <m>t</m>-distribution.
      A <m>t</m>-distribution,
      shown as a solid line in <xref ref="tDistCompareToNormalDist">Figure</xref>,
      has a bell shape.
      However, its tails are thicker than the normal model's.
      We can see that a greater proportion of the area under the <m>t</m>-distribution is beyond 2 standard units from 0 than under the normal distribution.
      These extra thick tails are exactly the correction we need to resolve the problem of a poorly estimated standard deviation.
    </p>

      <image width="57%" source="images/tDistCompareToNormalDist.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      The <m>t</m>-distribution,
      always centered at zero, has a single parameter: degrees of freedom.
      The <em>degrees of freedom (df)</em><idx><h>degrees of freedom (df)</h><h><m>t</m>-distribution|textbf</h></idx> describes the precise form of the bell-shaped <m>t</m>-distribution.
      Several <m>t</m>-distributions are shown in <xref ref="tDistConvergeToNormalDist">Figure</xref>.
      When there are more degrees of freedom,
      the <m>t</m>-distribution looks more like the standard normal distribution.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="tDistConvergeToNormalDist">
      <caption>The larger the degrees of freedom, the more closely the <m>t</m>-distribution resembles the standard normal distribution.</caption>

      <p>
        The degrees of freedom describes the shape of the <m>t</m>-distribution.
        The larger the degrees of freedom,
        the more closely the distribution resembles the standard normal<nbsp/>distribution.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      When the degrees of freedom is large, about 30 or more,
      the <m>t</m>-distribution is nearly indistinguishable from the normal distribution.
      In <xref ref="tDistSolutionToSEProblem">Section</xref>,
      we will see how degrees of freedom relates to sample size.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will find it useful to become familiar with the <m>t</m>-distribution,
      because it plays a very similar role to the normal distribution during inference.
      We use a <em><m>t</m>-table</em>,
          <idx><h>t-table@<m>t</m>-table|textbf</h></idx>
      partially shown in <xref ref="tTableSample_ch_inf_means">Figure</xref>,
      in place of the normal probability table when the population standard deviation is unknown,
      especially when the sample size is small.
      A<nbsp/>larger table is presented in <xref ref="tDistributionTable">Appendix</xref>.

      Each row in the <m>t</m>-table represents a <m>t</m>-distribution with different degrees of freedom.
      The columns correspond to tail probabilities.
      For instance,
      if we know we are working with the <m>t</m>-distribution with <m>df=18</m>,
      we can examine row 18,
      which is <em>highlighted</em> in <xref ref="tTableSample_ch_inf_means">Figure</xref>.
      If we want the value in this row that identifies the cutoff for an upper tail of 10%, we can look in the column where
      <em>one tail</em> is 0.100.
      This cutoff is 1.33.
      If we had wanted the cutoff for the lower 10%, we would use -1.33.
      Just like the normal distribution,
      all <m>t</m>-distributions are symmetric.

      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          We identify the row in the <m>t</m>-table using the degrees of freedom:
          <m>df=20</m>.
          Then we look for 1.65; it is not listed.
          It falls between the first and second columns.
          Since these values bound 1.65,
          their tail areas will bound the tail area corresponding to 1.65.
          We identify the one tail area of the first and second columns, 0.050 and 0.10,
          and we conclude that between 5% and 10% of the distribution is more than 1.65 standard deviations above the mean.
          If we like, we can identify the precise area using statistical software: 0.0573.

    <title>Checking conditions for inference on a mean using the <m>t</m>-distribution</title>
    <p>
      Using the <m>t</m>-distribution for inference on a mean requires two assumptions,
      namely that the observations are independent and that the theoretical sampling distribution of the sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m> is nearly normal.
      In practice,
      we check whether these assumptions are reasonable by verifying that certain conditions are met.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <title>Independent.</title>
          <p>
            Observations can be considered independent when the data are collected from a
            <em>random process</em>,
            such as tossing a coin, or from a <em>random sample</em>.
            Without a random sample or process,
            the standard error formula would not apply,
            and it is unclear to what population the inference would apply.
            Recall from <xref ref="ch_inference_for_props">Chapter</xref>
            that when sampling without replacement from a finite population,
            the observations can be considered independent when sampling less than 10% of the population.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Nearly normal sampling distribution.</title>
          <p>
            We saw in <xref ref="distributionofxbar">Section</xref>
            that the sampling distribution of a sample mean will be nearly normal when the sample is drawn from a nearly normal population or when the sample size is at least 30
            (<m>n\ge 30</m>).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      What should we do when the sample size is small and we are not sure whether the population distribution is nearly normal?
      In this case,
      the best we can do is look at the data for excessive skew.
      If the data are very skewed or have obvious outliers,
      this suggests that the sample did not come from a nearly normal population.
      However, if the data do not show obvious skew or outliers,
      then the idea of a nearly normal population is generally considered <em>reasonable</em>,
      making the assumption of a nearly normal sampling distribution for <m>\bar{x}</m> reasonable as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that by looking at a small data set,
      we cannot <em>prove</em> that the population distribution is nearly normal.
      However, the data can suggest to us whether the population distribution being nearly normal is an unreasonable assumption.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title></title>
      <p>
        {If the sample is small and there is strong skew or extreme outliers in the data,
        the population from which the sample was drawn may not be nearly normal. }
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      Ideally, we use a graph of the data to check for strong skew or outliers.
      When the full data set is not available,
      summary statistics can also be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sample size goes up,
      it becomes less necessary to check for skew in the data.
      If the sample size is 30 or more,
      it is no longer necessary that the population distribution be nearly normal.
      When the sample size is large,
      the Central Limit Theorem tells us that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be nearly normal regardless of the distribution of the population.

      Dolphins are at the top of the oceanic food chain,

    <p>
      Because we are estimating a mean,
      we would like to construct a <m>t</m>-interval,
      but first we must check whether the conditions for using a <m>t</m>-interval are met.
      We will start by assuming that the sample of 19 Risso's dolphins constitutes a random sample.
      Next, we note that the sample size is small
      (less than 30),
      and we do not know whether the distribution of mercury content for all dolphins is nearly normal.
      Therefore, we must look at the data.
      Since we do not have all of the data to graph,
      we look at the summary statistics provided in <xref ref="summaryStatsOfHgInMuscleOfRissosDolphins">Figure</xref>.
      These summary statistics do not suggest any strong skew or outliers;
      all observations are within 2.5 standard deviations of the mean.
      Based on this evidence,
      we believe it is reasonable that the population distribution of mercury content in dolphins could be nearly normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      With both conditions met, we will construct a 95% confidence interval.
      Recall that a confidence interval has the following form:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ point estimate }  \ \pm\  \text{ critical value } \times SE\text{ of estimate }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The point estimate is the sample mean and the <m>SE</m> of the sample mean is given by <m>s/\sqrt{n}</m>.
      What do we use for the critical value?
      Since we are using the <m>t</m>-distribution,
      we use a <m>t</m>-table to find the critical value.
      We denote the critical value <m>t^{\star}</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            For a 95% confidence interval,
            we want to find the cutoff
            <m>t^{\star}</m> such that 95% of the <m>t</m>-distribution is between -<m>t^{\star}</m> and <m>t^{\star}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Using the <m>t</m>-table on <xref ref="tTableSample_ch_inf_means">page</xref>,
            we look at the row that corresponds to the degrees of freedom and the column that corresponds to the confidence level.
          </p>

      <title></title>
      <p>
        If the sample has <m>n</m> observations and we are examining a single mean,
        then we use the <m>t</m>-distribution with <m>df=n-1</m> degrees of freedom.

    <example>

          Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average mercury content in dolphin muscles based on this sample.
          Recall that <m>n=19</m>,
          <m>\bar{x}=4.4</m> <m>\mu</m>g/wet g, and <m>s=2.3</m> <m>\mu</m>g/wet g.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          To find the critical value
          <m>t^{\star}</m> we use the <m>t</m>-distribution with <m>n-1</m> degrees of freedom.
          The sample size is 19, so <m>df=19-1=18</m> degrees of freedom.
          Using the <m>t</m>-table with row <m>df=18</m> and column corresponding to a 95% confidence level,
          we get <m>t^{\star}=2.10</m>.
          The point estimate is the sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m> and the standard error of a sample mean is given by <m>\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}</m>.
          Now we have all the pieces we need to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average mercury content in dolphin muscles.

    <title>Choosing a sample size when estimating a mean</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>margin of error</h></idx>
      In <xref ref="moeproportion">Section</xref>, we looked at sample size considerations when estimating a proportion.
      We take the same approach when estimating a mean.
      Recall that the margin of error is measured as the distance between the point estimate and the upper or lower bound of the confidence interval.
      We want to estimate a mean with a particular confidence level while putting an upper bound on the margin of error.
      What is the smallest sample size that will satisfy these conditions?
    </p>
    <p>
      For a one sample <m>t</m>-interval,
      the margin of error, <m>ME</m>,
      is given by <m>ME = t^{\star}\times\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}</m>.
      The challenge in this case is that we need to know <m>n</m> to find <m>t^{\star}</m>.
      But <m>n</m> is precisely what we are attempting to solve for!
      Fortunately,
      in most cases we will have a reasonable estimate for the population standard deviation and the desired <m>n</m> will be large,
      so we can use <m>ME = z^{\star}\times\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</m>,
      making it easier to solve for <m>n</m>.

          The standard deviation of systolic blood pressure for people in the U.S. is about 25 mmHg
          (millimeters of mercury).
          How large of a sample is necessary to estimate the average systolic blood pressure of people in a particular town with a margin of error no greater than 4 mmHg using a 95% confidence level?

        To estimate the minimum sample size required to achieve a margin of error less than or equal to <m>m</m>,
        with C% confidence, we set up an inequality as follows:

        <m>z^{\star}</m> depends on the desired confidence level and <m>\sigma</m> is the standard deviation associated with the population.

    <title>Hypothesis testing for a mean</title>
    <p>
      Is the typical U.S. runner getting faster or slower over time?
      Technological advances in shoes,
      training, and diet might suggest runners would be faster.
      An opposing viewpoint might say that with the average body mass index on the rise,
      people tend to run slower.
      In fact, all of these components might be influencing run time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We consider this question in the context of the Cherry Blossom Race,
      which is a 10-mile race in Washington, DC each<nbsp/>spring.
      The average time for all runners who finished the Cherry Blossom Race in 2006 was 93.3 minutes (93 minutes and about 18 seconds).
      We want to determine using data from 100 participants in the 2017 Cherry Blossom Race whether runners in this race are getting faster or slower,
      versus the other possibility that there has been no change.
      <xref ref="run17SampTimeHistogram">Figure</xref>

      The data come from a random sample from a large population,
      so the observations are independent.
      Do we need to check for skew in the data?
      No <mdash/> with a sample size of 100, well over 30,
      the Central Limit Theorem tells us that the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> will be nearly normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      With independence satisfied and slight skew not a concern for this large of a sample,
      we can proceed with performing a hypothesis test using the <m>t</m>-distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the 100 runners from the 2017 Cherry Blossom Race are 97.3 and 17.0 minutes,
      respectively.
      We want to know whether the observed sample mean of 97.3 is far enough away from 93.3 to provide convincing evidence of a real difference,
      or if it is within the realm of expected variation for a sample of size 100.
    </p>
    <p>
      To answer this question we will find the test statistic and p-value for the hypothesis test.
      Since we will be using a sample standard deviation in our calculation of the test statistic,
      we will need to use a <m>t</m>-distribution,
      just as we did with confidence intervals for a mean.
      We call the test statistic a <m>T</m>-statistic.
      It has the same general form as a Z-statistic.

                When calculating a test statistic for a mean,
