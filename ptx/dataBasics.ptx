  <title>Data basics</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      You collect data on dozens of questions from all of the students at your school.
      How would you organize all of this data?
      Effective presentation and description of data is a first step in most analyses.
      This section introduces one structure for organizing data as well as some terminology that will be used throughout this book.
      We use loan data from Lending Club and county data from the US Census Bureau to motivate and illustrate this section's learning objectives.

      <xref ref="loan50DF">Figure</xref>
      displays rows 1, 2, 3, and 50 of a data set for 50 randomly sampled loans offered through Lending Club,
      which is a peer-to-peer lending company.
      These observations will be referred to as the <c>loan50</c> data set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each row in the table represents a single loan.
      The formal name for a row is a <term>case</term>
      or <term>observational unit</term>.
          <idx><h>unit of observation</h></idx>
      The columns represent characteristics,
      called <em>variables</em>,
          <idx><h>variable|textbf</h></idx>
      for each of the loans.
      For example,
      the first row represents a loan of $7,500 with an interest rate of 7.34%, where the borrower is based in Maryland (MD) and has an income of $70,000.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What is the grade of the first loan in <xref ref="loan50DF">Figure</xref>?
          And what is the home ownership status of the borrower for that first loan?
          For these Guided Practice questions,
          you can check your answer in the footnote.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      In practice,
      it is especially important to ask clarifying questions to ensure important aspects of the data are understood.
      For instance,
      it is always important to be sure we know what each variable means and the units of measurement.
      Descriptions of the <c>loan50</c> variables are given in <xref ref="loan50Variables">Figure</xref>.

      The data in <xref ref="loan50DF">Figure</xref>
      represent a <term>data matrix</term>,
      which is a convenient and common way to organize data,
      especially if collecting data in a spreadsheet.
      Each row of a data matrix corresponds to a unique case
      (observational unit),
      and each column corresponds to a variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When recording data,
      use a data matrix unless you have a very good reason to use a different structure.
      This structure allows new cases to be added as rows or new variables as new columns.

          The grades for assignments, quizzes,
          and exams in a course are often recorded in a gradebook that takes the form of a data matrix.
          How might you organize grade data using a data matrix?

      These data come from the US Census,

      Unlike the Decennial Census,

      As stated by the ACS website,
      these data help communities ``plan for hospitals and schools,
      support school lunch programs,
      improve emergency services, build bridges,
      and inform businesses looking to add jobs and expand to new markets,

    <title>Types of variables</title>
    <p>
      Examine the <c>unemp\usrate</c>, <c>pop</c>, <c>state</c>,
      and <c>median\usedu</c> variables in the <c>county</c> data set.
      Each of these variables is inherently different from the other three,
      yet some share certain characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      First consider <c>unemp\usrate</c>,
      which is said to be a <term>numerical</term>
      variable since it can take a wide range of numerical values,
      and it is sensible to add, subtract,
      or take averages with those values.
      On the other hand,
      we would not classify a variable reporting telephone area codes as numerical since the average,
      sum, and difference of area codes doesn't have any clear meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <c>pop</c> variable is also numerical,
      although it seems to be a little different than <c>unemp\usrate</c>.
      This variable of the population count can only take whole non-negative numbers (<c>0</c>, <c>1</c>, <c>2</c>, ...).
      For<nbsp/>this reason,
      the population variable is said to be <term>discrete</term>
      since it can only take numerical values with jumps.
      On the other hand,
      the unemployment rate variable is said to be <term>continuous</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The variable <c>state</c> can take up to 51 values after accounting for Washington, DC: <c>AL</c>, <c>AK</c>, ..., and <c>WY</c>.
      Because the responses themselves are categories, <c>state</c> is called a
      <term>categorical</term> variable,
      and the possible values are called the variable's <term>levels</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, consider the <c>median\usedu</c> variable,
      which describes the median education level of county residents and takes values <c>below\ushs</c>, <c>hs\usdiploma</c>, <c>some\uscollege</c>,
      or <c>bachelors</c> in each county.
      This variable seems to be a hybrid:
      it is a categorical variable but the levels have a natural ordering.
      A variable with these properties is called an
      <term>ordinal</term> variable,
      while a regular categorical variable without this type of special ordering is called a
      <term>nominal</term> variable.
      To simplify analyses,
      any ordinal variable in this book will be treated as a nominal (unordered) categorical variable.

    <title>Relationships between variables</title>

      Many analyses are motivated by a researcher looking for a relationship between two or more variables.
      A social scientist may like to answer some of the following questions:

        <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="(1)" xml:id="ownershipMultiUnitQuestion">
          <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      To answer these questions, data must be collected,

      Examining summary statistics
          <idx><h>summary statistic</h></idx>

    <p>
      Scatterplots
          <idx><h>scatterplot</h></idx>
      are one type of graph used to study the relationship between two numerical variables.
      <xref ref="multiunitsVsOwnership">Figure</xref>
      compares the variables <c>homeownership</c> and <c>multi\usunit</c>,
      which is the percent of units in multi-unit structures (e.g. apartments, condos).
      Each point on the plot represents a single county.
      For instance,
      the highlighted dot corresponds to County<nbsp/>413 in the <c>county</c> data set: Chattahoochee County, Georgia,
      which has 39.4% of units in multi-unit structures and a homeownership rate of 31.3%. The scatterplot suggests a relationship between the two variables:
      counties with a higher rate of multi-units tend to have lower homeownership rates.
      We might brainstorm as to why this relationship exists and investigate the ideas to determine which are the most reasonable explanations.

          which is visualized as a scatterplot in <xref ref="pop_change_v_med_income">Figure</xref>.
          Are these variables associated?

      <answer>
        <p>
          The larger the median household income for a county,
          the higher the population growth observed for the county.
          While this trend isn't true for every county,
          the trend in the plot is evident.
          Since there is some relationship between the variables,
          they are associated.

        <p>
          Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California.
          During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations.
          Specifically,
          levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million,
          nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million,
          and coarse particulate matter (PM<m>_{10}</m>) in <m>\mu g/m^3</m>.
          Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993,
          and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth.
          The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM<m>_{10}</m> and,
          to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.\footfullcite{Ritz+Yu+Chapa+Fruin:2000}

          The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko,
          a Russian doctor, in 1952.
          Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life.
          In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method,
          researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment.
          These patients were randomnly split into two research groups:
          one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not.
          Patients were scored on quality of life, activity,
          asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10.
          On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.\footfullcite{McDowan:2003}

          Researchers studying the relationship between honesty,
          age and self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15.
          Participants reported their age, sex,
          and whether they were an only child or not.
          The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome
          (white or black)
          on a paper sheet,
          and said they would only reward children who report white.\footfullcite{Bucciol:2011}

                The study's findings can be summarized as follows: "Half the students were explicitly told not to cheat and the others were not given any explicit instructions.
                In the no instruction group probability of cheating was found to be uniform across groups based on child's characteristics.
                In the group that was explicitly told to not cheat,
                girls were less likely to cheat,
                and while rate of cheating didn't vary by age for boys,
                it decreased with age for girls." How many variables were recorded for each subject in the study in order to conclude these findings?

          In a study of the relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior, 129 University of California undergraduates at Berkeley were asked to identify themselves as having low or high social-class by comparing themselves to others with the most (least) money,
          most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs.
          They were also presented with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby laboratory,
          but that they could take some if they wanted.
          After completing some unrelated tasks,
          participants reported the number of candies they had taken.\footfullcite{Piff:2012}

          introduced a study exploring whether acupuncture had any effect on migraines.
          Researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups:
          treatment or control.
          The patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that was specifically designed to treat migraines.
          The patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture
          (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received acupuncture,
          they were asked if they were pain free.
