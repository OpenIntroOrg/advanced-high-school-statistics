      What proportion of adults have systolic blood pressure above 140?
      What is the probability of getting more than 250 heads in 400 tosses of a fair coin?
      If the average weight of a piece of carry-on luggage is 11 pounds,
      what is the probability that 200 random carry on pieces will weigh more than 2500 pounds?
      If 55% of a population supports a certain candidate,
      what is the probability that she will have less than 50% support in a random sample of size 200?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one distribution that can help us answer all of these questions.
      Can you guess what it is?
      That's right <mdash/> it's the normal distribution.

    <title>Normal distribution model</title>
    <p>
      Among all the distributions we see in practice,
      one is overwhelmingly the most common.
      The symmetric,
      unimodal, bell curve is ubiquitous throughout statistics.
      Indeed it is so common,
      that people often know it as the <term>normal curve</term>
      or <em>normal distribution</em>.
          <idx><h>distribution</h><h>normal|textbf</h></idx>
      <fn>
      It is also introduced as the Gaussian distribution after Frederic Gauss,
      the first person to formalize its mathematical expression.
      </fn> A normal curve is shown in <xref ref="simpleNormal">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="simpleNormal">

      <image width="60%" source="images/simpleNormal.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      The <term>normal distribution</term>
      always describes a symmetric,
      unimodal, bell-shaped curve.
      However, these curves can look different depending on the details of the model.
      Specifically,
      the normal distribution model can be adjusted using two parameters:
      mean and standard deviation.
      As you can probably guess,
      changing the mean shifts the bell curve to the left or right,
      while changing the standard deviation stretches or constricts the curve.
      <xref ref="twoSampleNormals">Figure</xref>
      shows the normal distribution with mean <m>0</m> and standard deviation <m>1</m> in the left panel and the normal distributions with mean <m>19</m> and standard deviation <m>4</m> in the right panel.
      <xref ref="twoSampleNormalsStacked">Figure</xref>
      shows these distributions on the same axis.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      Because the mean and standard deviation describe a normal distribution exactly,
      they are called the distribution's <em>parameters</em>.
          <idx><h>parameter|textbf</h></idx>
      The normal distribution with mean <m>\mu=0</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma = 1</m> is called the
      <term>standard normal distribution</term>..

      <p>
        Many variables are nearly normal,
        but none are exactly normal.
        The normal distribution, while never perfect,
        provides very close approximations for a variety of scenarios.
        We will use it to model data as well as probability distributions.

    <title>Standardizing with Z-scores</title>
    <p>
      We often want to put data onto a standardized scale,
      which can make comparisons more reasonable.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="actSAT">
      <statement>
        <p>
          <xref ref="satACTstats">Figure</xref>
          shows the mean and standard deviation for total scores on the SAT and ACT. The distribution of SAT and ACT scores are both nearly normal.
          Suppose Ann scored 1300 on her SAT and Tom scored 24 on his ACT. Who performed better?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          We use the standard deviation as a guide.
          Ann is 1 standard deviation above average on the SAT: <m>\satmean{} + \satsd{} = \annsatscore{}</m>.
          Tom is 0.5 standard deviations above the mean on the ACT: <m>\actmean{} + \tomsatzscore{} \times \actsd{} = \tomsatscore{}</m>.
          In <xref ref="satActNormals">Figure</xref>,
          we can see that Ann tends to do better with respect to everyone else than Tom did,
          so her score was better.

      <xref ref="actSAT">Example</xref>
      used a standardization technique called a Z-score,
      a method most commonly employed for nearly normal observations but that may be used with any distribution.
      Recall from Chapter 2 that the <term>Z-score</term>
      of an observation is defined as the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean.
      If the observation is one standard deviation above the mean,
      its Z-score is<nbsp/>1.
      If it is 1.5 standard deviations <em>below</em>
      the mean, then its Z-score is -1.5.
      If <m>x</m> is an observation from a distribution with mean <m>\mu</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma</m>,
      we define the Z-score mathematically as
      <md>
        <mrow>Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Using <m>\mu_{SAT} = \satmean{}</m>,
      <m>\sigma_{SAT} = \satsd{}</m>,
      and <m>x_{_{\text{ Ann } }} = \annsatscore{}</m>, we find Ann's Z-score:
      <md>
        <mrow>Z_{_{\text{ Ann } }} = \frac{x_{_{\text{ Ann } }} - \mu_{_{\text{ SAT } }}} {\sigma_{_{\text{ SAT } }}} = \frac{\annsatscore{} - \satmean{}}{\satsd{}} = \annsatzscore{}</mrow>
      </md>

    <exercise>
      <statement>

          Use Tom's ACT score, 24,

    <title>Normal probability table</title>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Ann from <xref ref="actSAT">Example</xref>
          earned a score of 1300 on her SAT with a corresponding <m>Z=1</m>.
          She would like to know what percentile she falls in among all SAT test-takers.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Ann's <term>percentile</term> is the percentage of people who earned a lower SAT score than Ann.
          We shade the area representing those individuals in <xref ref="satBelow1300">Figure</xref>.
          The total area under the normal curve is always equal to 1, and the proportion of people who scored below Ann on the SAT is equal to the <em>area</em>
          shaded in <xref ref="satBelow1300">Figure</xref>: 0.8413.
          In other words, Ann is in the <m>84^{th}</m> percentile of SAT takers.

    </figure>
    <p>
      We can use the normal model to find percentiles.
      A <term>normal probability table</term>,
      which lists Z-scores and corresponding percentiles,
      can be used to identify a percentile based on the Z-score
      (and vice versa).
      Statistical software can also be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      A normal probability table is given in <xref ref="normalProbabilityTable">Appendix</xref>
      and abbreviated in <xref ref="zTableShort">Figure</xref>.
      We use this table to identify the percentile corresponding to any particular Z-score.
      For instance,
      the percentile of <m>Z=0.43</m> is shown in row <m>0.4</m> and column <m>0.03</m> in <xref ref="zTableShort">Figure</xref>: 0.6664,
      or the <m>66.64^{th}</m> percentile.
      Generally, we round <m>Z</m> to two decimals,
      identify the proper row in the normal probability table up through the first decimal,
      and then determine the column representing the second decimal value.
      The intersection of this row and column is the percentile of the observation.

      We can also find the Z-score associated with a percentile.
      For example, to identify Z for the <m>80^{th}</m> percentile,
      we look for the value closest to 0.8000 in the middle portion of the table: 0.7995.
      We determine the Z-score for the <m>80^{th}</m> percentile by combining the row and column Z values: 0.84.

          respectively.
          For instance,
          first find the area that falls between <m>Z=-1</m> and <m>Z=1</m>,
          which should have an area of about 0.68.

      It is possible for a normal random variable to fall 4,<nbsp/>5,

      The probability of being further than 4 standard deviations from the mean is about 1-in-15,000.

    <title>Evaluating the normal approximation</title>
    <p>
      It is important to remember normality is always an approximation.
      Testing the appropriateness of the normal assumption is a key step in many data analyses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distribution of heights of US males is well approximated by the normal model.
      We are interested in proceeding under the assumption that the data are normally distributed,
      but first we must check to see if this is reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two visual methods for checking the assumption of normality that can be implemented and interpreted quickly.
      The first is a simple histogram with the best fitting normal curve overlaid on the plot,
      as shown in the left panel of <xref ref="fcidMHeights">Figure</xref>.
      The sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m> and standard deviation <m>s</m> are used as the parameters of the best fitting normal curve.
      The closer this curve fits the histogram,
      the more reasonable the normal model assumption.
      Another more common method is examining a
      <term>normal probability plot</term>,<fn>
      Also commonly called a <term>quantile-quantile plot</term>.
      </fn> shown in the right panel of <xref ref="fcidMHeights">Figure</xref>.
      The closer the points are to a perfect straight line,
      the more confident we can be that the data follow the normal model.
    </p>

      <caption>A sample of 100 male heights. The observations are rounded to the nearest whole inch, explaining why the points appear to jump in increments in the normal probability plot.</caption>

      and 400 samples were simulated from a normal distribution,
      and the histograms and normal probability plots of the data sets are shown in <xref ref="normalExamples">Figure</xref>.
      These will provide a benchmark for what to look for in plots of real data.

      The data set is too small to really see clear structure in the histogram.
      The normal probability plot also reflects this,
      where there are some deviations from the line.
      However, these deviations are not strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The middle panels show diagnostic plots for the data set with 100 simulated observations.
      The histogram shows more normality and the normal probability plot shows a better fit.
      While there is one observation that deviates noticeably from the line,
      it is not particularly extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data set with 400 observations has a histogram that greatly resembles the normal distribution,
      while the normal probability plot is nearly a perfect straight line.
      Again in the normal probability plot there is one observation
      (the largest)
      that deviates slightly from the line.
      If that observation had deviated 3 times further from the line,
      it would be of much greater concern in a real data set.
      Apparent outliers can occur in normally distributed data but they are rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice the histograms look more normal as the sample size increases,
      and the normal probability plot becomes straighter and more stable.

          Based on the graphs, are NBA player heights normally distributed?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          We first create a histogram and normal probability plot of the NBA player heights.
          The histogram in the left panel is slightly left skewed,
          which contrasts with the symmetric normal distribution.
          The points in the normal probability plot do not appear to closely follow a straight line but show what appears to be a
          <q>wave</q>. We can compare these characteristics to the sample of 400 normally distributed observations in <xref ref="normalExamplesExample">Example</xref>
          and see that they represent much stronger deviations from the normal model.
          NBA player heights do not appear to come from a normal distribution.

    <title>Normal approximation for sums of random variables</title>
    <p>
      We have seen that many distributions are approximately normal.
      The sum and the difference of normally distributed variables is also normal.
      While we cannot prove this here,
      the usefulness of it is seen in the following example.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Three friends are playing a cooperative video game in which they have to complete a puzzle as fast as possible.
          Assume that the individual times of the 3 friends are independent of each other.
          The individual times of the friends in similar puzzles are approximately normally distributed with the following means and standard deviations.

        </tabular>
        <p>
          To advance to the next level of the game,
          the friends' total time must not exceed 17.1 minutes.
          What is the probability that they will advance to the next level?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Because each friend's time is approximately normally distributed,
          <em>the sum of their times is also approximately normally distributed</em>.
          We will do a normal approximation,
          but first we need to find the mean and standard deviation of the <em>sum</em>.
          We learned how to do this in <xref ref="randomVariablesSection">Section</xref>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let the three friends be labeled <m>X</m>, <m>Y</m>, <m>Z</m>.
          We want <m>P(X + Y + Z \lt  17.1)</m>.
          The mean and standard deviation of the sum of <m>X</m>,
          <m>Y</m>, and <m>Z</m> is given by:
          <md>
            <mrow>\mu_{sum} \amp = E(X+Y+Z) \amp  \sigma_{sum}\amp = \sqrt{(SD_X)^2+(SD_Y)^2 + (SD_Z)^2}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = E(X) + E(Y) + E(Z) \amp  \amp = \sqrt{(0.11)^2+(0.13)^2+(0.12)^2}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =4.6+4.8+4.5 \amp  \amp = 0.208</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =17.5</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can find the Z-score.
          <md>
            <mrow>Z \amp = \frac{x_{sum}-\mu_{sum}}{\sigma_{sum}}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\frac{17.1-17.5}{0.208}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =-1.92</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we want the probability that the sum is less than 17.5, so we shade the area to the left of <m>Z = -1.92</m>.
          Using the normal table or a calculator, we get
          <md>
            <mrow>P(Z \lt  -1.92) = 0.027</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a 2.7% chance that the friends will advance to the next level.

          A <term>Z-score</term> represents the number of standard deviations a value in a data set is above or below the mean.

          <em>Z-scores do not depend on units</em>.
          When looking at distributions with different units or different standard deviations, \mbox{Z-scores} are useful for comparing how far values are away from the mean

        <p>
          In triathlons,
          it is common for racers to be placed into age and gender groups.
          Friends Leo and Mary both completed the Hermosa Beach Triathlon,
          where Leo competed in the <em>Men, Ages 30 - 34</em>
          group while Mary competed in the
          <em>Women, Ages 25 - 29</em> group.
          Leo completed the race in 1:22:28 (4948 seconds),
          while Mary completed the race in 1:31:53 (5513 seconds).
          Obviously Leo finished faster,
          but they are curious about how they did within their respective groups.
          Can you help them?
          Here is some information on the performance of their groups:
