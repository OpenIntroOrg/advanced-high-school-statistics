In each part, we can write the woman's age as a linear function of 
the spouse's age. \\
(a)~$age_{W} = age_{S} + 3$. \\
(b)~$age_{W} = age_{S} - 2$. \\
(c)~$age_{W} = 2 \times age_{S}$. \\
Since the slopes are positive and these are perfect linear 
relationships, the correlation will be exactly 1 in all three parts. 
An alternative way to gain insight into this solution is to create a 
mock data set, e.g. 5 women aged 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30, then find the 
spouses ages for each women in each part and create a scatterplot.
