(a)~$H_0$: $\beta = 0$. $H_A$: $\beta \neq 0$.
The p-value, as reported in the table, is incredibly small
and is smaller than 0.05, so we reject $H_0$.
The data provide convincing evidence that women's and spouses' 
heights are positively correlated. \\
(b)~$\widehat{height}_{S} = 43.5755 + 0.2863 \times height_{W}$. \\
(c)~Slope: For each additional inch in woman's height, the spouse's height is expected to be an additional 0.2863 inches, on 
average. Intercept: Women who are 0 inches tall are predicted to have 
spouses who are 43.5755 inches tall. The intercept here is 
meaningless, and it serves only to adjust the height of the line. \\
(d)~The slope is positive, so $r$ must also be positive. 
$r = \sqrt{0.09} = 0.30$. \\
(e)~63.2612. Since $R^2$ is low, the prediction based on this 
regression model is not very reliable. \\
(f)~No, we should avoid extrapolating.
