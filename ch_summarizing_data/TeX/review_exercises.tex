% 43 - makeup_exam

\eoce{\qt{Make-up exam\label{makeup_exam}} \videosolution{ahss_eoce_sol-makeup_exam} In a class of 25 students, 24 of them took an exam 
in class and 1 student took a make-up exam the following day. The professor graded the 
first batch of 24 exams and found an average score of 74 points with a standard 
deviation of 8.9 points. The student who took the make-up the following day scored 64 
points on the exam.
\begin{parts}
\item Does the new student's score increase or decrease the average score?
\item What is the new average?
\item Does the new student's score increase or decrease the standard deviation of the 
scores?

% 44 - infant_mortality_rel_freq

\eoce{\qt{Infant mortality\label{infant_mortality}} The infant mortality rate is defined as 
the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births. This rate is often used as an 
indicator of the level of health in a country. The relative frequency histogram below 
shows the distribution of estimated infant death rates for 224 countries for which such 
data were available in 2014.

% 45 - dist_shape_tv_watchers

\eoce{\qt{TV watchers\label{dist_shape_TV_watchers}} Students in an AP Statistics class 
were asked how many hours of television they watch per week (including online 
streaming). This sample yielded an average of 4.71 hours, with a standard 
deviation of 4.18 hours. Is the distribution of number of hours students watch 
television weekly symmetric? If not, what shape would you expect this distribution 
to have? Explain your reasoning.

% 46 - new_stat

\eoce{\qt{A new statistic\label{new_stat}} The statistic $\frac{\bar{x}}{median}$ can 
be used as a measure of skewness. Suppose we have a distribution where all 
observations are greater than 0, $x_i > 0$. What is the expected shape of 
the distribution under the following conditions? Explain your reasoning.
\begin{parts}
\item $\frac{\bar{x}}{median} = 1$
\item $\frac{\bar{x}}{median} < 1$
\item $\frac{\bar{x}}{median} > 1$

% 51 - birth_weight

\eoce{\qt{Birth weight\label{birth_weight}}
In a large study of birth weight of newborns, the weights of 23,419 newborn boys were recorded. The distribution of weights was approximately normal with a mean of 7.44 lbs (3376 grams) and a standard deviation of 1.33 lbs (603 grams). The government classifies a newborn as having low birth weight if the weight is less than 5.5 pounds.\footnote{\oiRedirect{textbook-birthweight_for_Scottish_singleton_births}{www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/8/5}}
\begin{parts}
\item What percent of these newborns had a low birth weight?
\item Approximately what percent of these babies weighed greater than 10 pounds?
\item Approximately \emph{how many} of these newborns weighed greater than 10 pounds?
\item How much would a newborn have to weigh in order to be at the 90th percentile among this group?

\item What is the Z-score that corresponds to the top 25\% (or the $75^{th}$ 
percentile) of the standard normal distribution?

percentile?
\item Identify the standard deviation of insurance premiums in California.
