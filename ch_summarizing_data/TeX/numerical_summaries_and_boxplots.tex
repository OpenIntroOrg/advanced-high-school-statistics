\eoce{\qt{Smoking habits of UK residents, Part I\label{UKSmoking_amounts}} A survey was conducted to study the smoking habits of UK residents. The histograms below display the distributions of the number of cigarettes smoked on weekdays and weekends, and they exclude data from people who identified themselves as non-smokers. Describe the two distributions and compare them. \footfullcite{data:smoking}

\eoce{\qt{Days off at a mining plant\label{days_off_mining}} Workers at a particular mining 
site receive an average of 35 days paid vacation, which is lower than the national 
average. The manager of this plant is under pressure from a local union to increase the 
amount of paid time off. However, he does not want to give more days off to the workers 
because that would be costly. Instead he decides he should fire 10 employees in such a 
way as to raise the average number of days off that are reported by his employees. In 
order to achieve this goal, should he fire employees who have the most number of days 
off, least number of days off, or those who have about the average number of days off?

\eoce{\qt{Air quality\label{air_quality_durham}} Daily air quality is measured by the air 
quality index (AQI) reported by the Environmental Protection Agency. This index reports 
the pollution level and what associated health effects might be a concern. The index is 
calculated for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act and takes values 
from 0 to 300, where a higher value indicates lower air quality. AQI was reported for a 
sample of 91 days in 2011 in Durham, NC. The relative frequency histogram below shows 
the distribution of the AQI values on these days. \footfullcite{data:durhamAQI:2011} \\

median? Explain your reasoning.

high AQI? Explain your reasoning.
