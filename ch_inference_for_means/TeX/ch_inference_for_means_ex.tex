\eoce{\qt{Auto exhaust and lead exposure} Researchers interested in lead exposure due to car exhaust sampled the blood of 52 police officers subjected to constant inhalation of automobile exhaust fumes while working traffic enforcement in a primarily urban environment. The blood samples of these officers had an average lead concentration of 124.32 $\mu$g/l  and a SD of 37.74 $\mu$g/l; a previous study of individuals from a nearby suburb, with no history of exposure, found an average blood level concentration of 35 $\mu$g/l.\footfullcite{Mortada:2000}

\eoce{\qt{Global warming, Part I} \label{warming} Is there strong evidence of global warming? Let's consider a small scale example, comparing how temperatures have changed in the US from 1968 to 2008. The daily high temperature reading on January 1 was collected in 1968 and 2008 for 51 randomly selected locations in the continental US. Then the difference between the two readings (temperature in 2008 - temperature in 1968) was calculated for each of the 51 different locations. The average of these 51 values was 1.1 degrees with a standard deviation of 4.9 degrees. We are interested in determining whether these data provide strong evidence of temperature warming in the continental US.

\eoce{\qt{Diamonds, Part I} \label{diamonds} Prices of diamonds are determined by what is known as the 4 Cs: cut, clarity, color, and carat weight. The prices of diamonds go up as the carat weight increases, but the increase is not smooth. For example, the difference between the size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye, but the price of a 1 carat diamond tends to be much higher than the price of a 0.99 diamond. In this question we use two random samples of diamonds, 0.99 carats and 1 carat, each sample of size 23, and compare the average prices of the diamonds. In order to be able to compare equivalent units, we first divide the price for each diamond by 100 times its weight in carats. That is, for a 0.99 carat diamond, we divide the price by 99. For a 1 carat diamond, we divide the price by 100. The distributions and some sample statistics are shown below.\footfullcite{ggplot2} \\[1mm]

\eoce{\qt{Fuel efficiency of manual and automatic cars, Part I} \label{fuelEff} Each year the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) releases fuel economy data on cars manufactured in that year. Below are summary statistics on fuel efficiency (in miles/gallon) from random samples of cars with manual and automatic transmissions manufactured in 2012. Do these data provide strong evidence of a difference between the average fuel efficiency of cars with manual and automatic transmissions in terms of their average city mileage? Assume that conditions for inference are satisfied. \footfullcite{data:epaMPG}

\eoce{\qt{Chicken diet and weight, Part II} \label{chicksCasein} Casein is a common weight gain supplement for humans. Does it have an effect on chickens? Using data provided in Exercise~\ref{chicks}, test the hypothesis that the average weight of chickens that were fed casein is different than the average weight of chickens that were fed soybean. If your hypothesis test yields a statistically significant result, discuss whether or not the higher average weight of chickens can be attributed to the casein diet. Assume that conditions for inference are satisfied.

\eoce{\qt{Fuel efficiency of manual and automatic cars, Part II} The table provides summary statistics on highway fuel economy of cars manufactured in 2012 (from Exercise~\ref{fuelEff}). Use these statistics to calculate a 98\% confidence interval for the difference between average highway mileage of manual and automatic cars, and interpret this interval in the context of the data.\footfullcite{data:epaMPG}

\eoce{\qt{Gaming and distracted eating, Part I} \label{gaming} A group of researchers are interested in the possible effects of distracting stimuli during eating, such as an increase or decrease in the amount of food consumption. To test this hypothesis, they monitored food intake for a group of 44 patients who were randomized into two equal groups. The treatment group ate lunch while playing solitaire, and the control group ate lunch without any added distractions. Patients in the treatment group ate 52.1 grams of biscuits, with a standard deviation of 45.1 grams, and patients in the control group ate 27.1 grams of biscuits, with a standard deviation of 26.4 grams. Do these data provide convincing evidence that the average food intake (measured in amount of biscuits consumed) is different for the patients in the treatment group? Assume that conditions for inference are satisfied. \footfullcite{Oldham:2011}

\eoce{\qt{Gaming and distracted eating, Part II} The researchers from Exercise~\ref{gaming} also investigated the effects of being distracted by a game on how much people eat. The 22 patients in the treatment group who ate their lunch while playing solitaire were asked to do a serial-order recall of the food lunch items they ate. The average number of items recalled by the patients in this group was 4.9, with a standard deviation of 1.8. The average number of items recalled by the patients in the control group (no distraction) was 6.1, with a standard deviation of 1.8. Do these data provide strong evidence that the average number of food items recalled by the patients in the treatment and control groups are different?

\eoce{\qt{Prison isolation experiment, Part I} \label{prison} Subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh,  NC, volunteered for an experiment involving an ``isolation'' experience. The goal of the experiment was to find a treatment that reduces subjects' psychopathic deviant $T$-scores. This score measures a person's need for control or their rebellion against control, and it is part of a commonly used mental health test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test. The experiment had three treatment groups: 
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute ``therapeutic"  tape advising that professional help is available.
\item Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute ``emotionally neutral'' tape on training hunting dogs.
\item Four hours of  sensory restriction but no taped message. 
\end{enumerate}
Forty-two subjects were randomly assigned to these treatment groups, and an MMPI test was administered before and after the treatment. Distributions of the differences between pre and post treatment scores (pre - post) are shown below, along with some sample statistics. Use this information to independently test the effectiveness of each treatment. Make sure to clearly state your hypotheses, check conditions, and interpret results in the context of the data.\footfullcite{data:prison}

\eoce{\qt{True / False: comparing means} Determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning for statements you identify as false.
\begin{parts}
\item When comparing means of two samples where $n_1 = 20$ and $n_2 = 40$, we can use the normal model for the difference in means since $n_2 \ge 30$.
\item As the degrees of freedom increases, the $t$-distribution approaches normality.
\item We use a pooled standard error for calculating the standard error of the difference between means when sample sizes of groups are equal to each other.
