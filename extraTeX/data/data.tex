Each data set within the text is described in this appendix,
and there is a corresponding page for each of these data sets at
\oiRedirect{data}
    {\color{black}\textbf{openintro.org/data}}.
This page also includes additional data sets that can be
used for honing your skills.
Each data set has its own page with the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item
    Description of each data set.
\item
    Detailed overview of each data set's variables.
\item
    CSV download.
\item
    R object file download.
\end{itemize}
Over time we will also expand the information available
on these pages.

    we decided to keep the context and examples.

    The actual data has more observations than were referenced
    in this chapter.
    That is, we used a subsample since it helped smooth some
    of the examples to have a bit more variability.
    The \data{pew\us{}energy\us{}2018} data set represents
    the full data set for each of the different energy source
    questions, which covers solar, wind, offshore drilling,
    hydrolic fracturing, and nuclear energy.

    In New York City on October 23rd, 2014, a doctor who had
    recently been treating Ebola patients in Guinea went to
    the hospital with a slight fever and was subsequently
    diagnosed with Ebola.
    Soon thereafter, an NBC~4 New York/The Wall Street
    Journal/Marist Poll found that
    82\% of New Yorkers favored a
    ``mandatory 21-day quarantine for anyone who has come
    in contact with an Ebola patient''.
    This poll included responses of 1,042
    New York adults between Oct 26th and~28th, 2014.

In 2018, the Gallup poll randomly sampled 1,033 adults in the U.S. and found that 53\% of them approved. \\
