\index{data|(}

Each data set within the text is described in this appendix.
For those data sets that are in multiple sections in a chapter,
only the first section is listed in that chapter.
If a data set is not listed here, e.g. Section~\ref{bayesTheoremSubsection}
lists imagined probabilities for whether a parking garage will
fill up and whether there is a sporting event that same evening
for an unnamed college, it may not be listed in this data appendix.
When a raw data set is available versus just a description,
there is a corresponding page for the data set at
\oiRedirect{data}
    {\color{black}\textbf{openintro.org/data}}.
That webpage also includes many more data sets than are
covered in this textbook,
and each data set on the website includes a description,
it's source, a detailed overview of each data set's variables,
and download options.
