\noindent We hope readers will take away three ideas from this book in addition to forming a foundation of statistical thinking and methods.\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[(1)] Statistics is an applied field with a wide range of practical applications.
\item[(2)] You don't have to be a math guru to learn from real, interesting data.
\item[(3)] Data are messy, and statistical tools are imperfect. But, when you understand the strengths and weaknesses of these tools, you can use them to learn about the real~world.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Textbook overview}

The chapters of this book are as follows:
\begin{description}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[1. Data collection.] Data structures, variables, and basic data collection techniques.
\item[2. Summarizing data.] Data summaries and graphics.
\item[3. Probability.] The basic principles of probability.
\item[4. Distributions of random variables.] Introduction to key distributions, and how the normal model applies to the sample mean and sample proportion.
\item[5. Foundation for inference.] General ideas for statistical inference in the context of estimating the population proportion.
\item[6. Inference for categorical data.] Inference for proportions using the normal and chi-square distributions.
\item[7. Inference for numerical data.] Inference for one or two sample means using the $t$ distribution.
\item[8. Introduction to linear regression.] An introduction to regression with two variables, and inference on the slope of the regression line.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Online resources}
OpenIntro is focused on increasing access to education by developing free, high-quality education materials. In addition to textbooks, we provide the following accompanying resources to help teachers and students be successful.

\begin{itemize}
\item Video overviews for each section of textbook
\item Casio and TI calculator tutorials
\item Lecture slides for each section of textbook
\item Video solutions for selected end of chapter exercises.
\item Statistical software labs
\item Downloadable data sets 
\item Interactive Tableau graphs to further explore the data
\end{itemize}

\noindent Find these resources and more at: \oiRedirect{os}
    {\color{black}\textbf{openintro.org/ahss}}.   Additionally, we provide two complete courses through the following Learning Management Systems (LMS):

\begin{itemize} 
\item \oiRedirect{ahss_canvas}{\color{black}\textbf{Canvas Commons}}\footnote{https://sfuhs.instructure.com/courses/1068}

Examples and Guided Practice throughout the textbook may be
identified as follows:

\begin{nexercise}
Guided Practice problems provide you, the reader, a chance to answer questions to test your understanding of the reading.  Answers are provided in a footnote at the bottom of the page, so that you can check your answers.
so we provide the full solution in a footnote.\footnotemark{}
%Readers are strongly encouraged to attempt these practice problems.

\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{Guided Practice solutions are always located down here!}

Students may find it useful to fill in the bullet after understanding the example or successfully completing the Guided Practice.

\subsection*{End of chapter exercises}

A large number of exercises are also provided at the end
of each chapter for practice or homework assignments.
Solutions are given for odd-numbered exercise in
Appendix~\ref{eoceSolutions}.


Probability tables for the normal, $t$, and chi-square distributions are in Appendix~\ref{distributionTables}, and PDF copies of these tables are also available from \oiRedirect{textbook-openintro}{\color{black}\textbf{openintro.org}} for anyone to download, print, share, or modify.
