\emph{Advanced High School Statistics} covers a first course in statistics, providing an introduction to applied statistics that is clear, concise, and accessible. This book was written to align with the AP$^{\text{\textregistered}}$ Statistics Course

We hope readers will take away three ideas from this book in addition to forming a foundation of statistical thinking and methods.\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[(1)] Statistics is an applied field with a wide range of practical applications.
\item[(2)] You don't have to be a math guru to learn from real, interesting data.
\item[(3)] Data are messy, and statistical tools are imperfect. But, when you understand the strengths and weaknesses of these tools, you can use them to learn about the real~world.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{{\color{oiB}Textbook overview}}

The chapters of this book are as follows:

\item[2. Summarizing data.] Data summaries and graphics.
\item[3. Probability.] The basic principles of probability.
\item[4. Distributions of random variables.] Introduction to key distributions, and how the normal model applies to the sample mean and sample proportion.
\item[5. Foundations for inference.] General ideas for statistical inference in the context of estimating the population proportion.
\item[6. Inference for categorical data.]
    Inference for proportions and contingency tables
    using the normal and chi-square distributions.

\item A small but growing number of \oiRedirect{ahss-desmos}{Desmos activities}\footnote{\oiRedirect{ahss-desmos}{openintro.org/ahss/desmos}}
\item \oiRedirect{ahss-quizlet}{Quizlet} sets for each chapter\footnote{\oiRedirect{ahss-quizlet}{quizlet.com/openintro-ahss}}
\item A \oiRedirect{ahss-tableau}{Tableau public} page to further interact with data sets\footnote{\oiRedirect{ahss-tableau}{public.tableau.com/profile/openintro}}
\item \oiRedirect{ahss2-online-temp}{Online, interactive version of textbook}\footnote{Developed by Emiliano Vega and Ralf Youtz of Portland Community College using PreTeXt.}
\item Complete companion course with the learning management software \oiRedirect{ahss_mom}{{MyOpenMath}}\footnote{\oiRedirect{myopenmath-ahss}{myopenmath.com/course/public.php?cid=11774}}

\noindent%	
We also have improved the ability to access data in this book
through the addition of Appendix~\ref{appendix_data},
which provides additional information for each of the data sets
used in the main text and is new in the Second Edition.
Online guides to each of these data sets are also provided at
\oiRedirect{data}
    {\color{black}\textbf{openintro.org/data}}
and through a
\oiRedirect{textbook-github_openintro}
    {companion R~package}.

\subsection*{{\color{oiB}Examples and exercises}}
%, and appendices}

\noindent%
Many examples are provided to establish an understanding of how
to apply methods.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{This is an example.}
  Full solutions to examples are provided here, within the example.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

\noindent%
When we think the reader should be ready to do an example problem on their own, we frame it as Guided Practice.

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
The reader may check or learn the answer to any Guided Practice
problem by reviewing the full solution in a footnote.\footnotemark{}
%Readers are strongly encouraged to attempt these practice problems.
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{Guided Practice solutions are always located down here!}

\noindent%
Exercises are also provided at the end of each section
and each chapter for practice or homework assignments.  
Solutions for odd-numbered exercises are given in
Appendix~\ref{eoceSolutions}.
