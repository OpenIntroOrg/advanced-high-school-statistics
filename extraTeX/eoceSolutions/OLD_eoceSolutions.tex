\eocesol{(a) Treatment: $10/43 = 0.23 \rightarrow 23\%$. Control: $2/46 = 0.04 \rightarrow 4\%$. (b) There is a 19\% difference between the pain reduction rates in the two groups. At first glance, it appears patients in the treatment group are more likely to experience pain reduction from the acupuncture treatment. (c) Answers may vary but should be sensible. Two possible answers: $^1$Though the groups' difference is big, I'm skeptical the results show a real difference and think this might be due to chance. $^2$The difference in these rates looks pretty big, so I suspect acupuncture is having a positive impact on pain.}

\eocesol{(a-i) 143,196 eligible study subjects born in Southern California between 1989 and 1993. (a-ii) Measurements of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter less than 10$\mu g/m^3$ (PM$_{10}$) collected at air-quality-monitoring stations as well as length of gestation. These are continuous numerical variables. (a-iii) The research question: ``Is there an association between air pollution exposure and preterm births?" (b-i) 600 adult patients aged 18-69 years diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. (b-ii) The variables were whether or not the patient practiced the Buteyko method (categorical) and measures of quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms and medication reduction of the patients (categorical, ordinal). It may also be reasonable to treat the ratings on a scale of 1 to 10 as discrete numerical variables. (b-iii) The research question: ``Do asthmatic patients who practice the Buteyko method experience improvement in their condition?"}

\eocesol{(a) $50 \times 3 = 150$. (b) Four continuous numerical variables: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. (c) One categorical variable, species, with three levels: \emph{setosa}, \emph{versicolor}, and \emph{virginica}.}

% 7
\eocesol{(a) Population of interest: all births in Southern California. Sample: 143,196 births between 1989 and 1993 in Southern California. If births in this time span can be considered to be representative of all births, then the results are generalizable to the population of Southern California. However, since the study is observational, the findings do not imply causal relationships. (b) Population: all 18-69 year olds diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. Sample: 600 adult patients aged 18-69 years diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. Since the sample consists of voluntary patients, the results cannot necessarily be generalized to the population at large. However, since the study is an experiment, the findings can be used to establish causal relationships.}

\eocesol{(a) Explanatory: number of study hours per week. Response: GPA. 
(b) There is a slight positive relationship between the two variables. One respondent reported a GPA above 4.0, which is a data error. There are also a few respondents who reported unusually high study hours (60 and 70 hours/week). The variability in GPA also appears to be larger for students who study less than those who study more. Since the data become sparse as the number of study hours increases, it is somewhat difficult to evaluate the strength of the relationship and also the variability across different numbers of study hours.
(c) Observational.
(d) Since this is an observational study, a causal relationship is not implied.}

% 13
\eocesol{(a) Observational.
(b) The professor suspects students in a given section may have similar feelings about the course. To ensure each section is reasonably represented, she may choose to randomly select a fixed number of students, say 10, from each section for a total sample size of 40 students. Since a random sample of fixed size was taken within each section in this scenario, this represents stratified sampling.}

% 15
\eocesol{(a) The relationship between life expectancy and percentage of internet users is positive, non-linear, and somewhat strong. 
(b) This is an observational study. 
(c) Countries in which a higher percentage of the population have access to the Internet are most probably developed countries which also tend to have a higher quality of life in general and also better health care. Whether or not the country is developed is a lurking variable here, since level of Internet access varies for underdeveloped, developing, and developed countries. (Note: Answers may vary.)}

% 17
\eocesol{Sampling from the phone book would miss unlisted phone numbers, so this would result in bias. People who do not have their numbers listed may share certain characteristics, e.g. consider that cell phones are not listed in phone books, so a sample from the phone book would not necessarily be a representative of the population.}

% 19
\eocesol{The estimate will be biased, and it will tend to overestimate the true family size. For example, suppose we had just two families: the first with 2 parents and 5 children, and the second with 2 parents and 1 child. Then if we draw one of the six children at random, 5 times out of 6 we would sample the larger family}

% 21
\eocesol{(a) Simple random sampling. This is usually an effective method as it assigns equal probability to each household to be picked.
(b) Stratified sampling. This is an effective method in this setting since neighborhoods are unique and this method allows us to sample from each neighborhood.
(c) Cluster sampling. This is not an effective method in this setting since the resulting sample will not contain households from certain neighborhoods and we are told that some neighborhoods are very different from others.
(d) Multi-stage sampling. This method will suffer from the same issue discussed in part (d).
(e) Convenience sampling. This is not an effective method since it will result in a biased sample for households that are similar to each other (in the same neighborhood) and the sample will not contain any houses from neighborhoods far from the city council offices.

% 23
\eocesol{(a) No, this is an observational study.
(b) This statement is not justified; it implies a causal association between sleep disorders and bullying. However, this was an observational study. A better conclusion would be ``School children identified as bullies are more likely to suffer from sleep disorders than non-bullies.''}

\eocesol{(a) Experiment, as the treatment was assigned to each patient.
(b)~Response: Duration of the cold. Explanatory: Treatment, with 4 levels: \emph{placebo}, \emph{1g}, \emph{3g}, \emph{3g with additives}.
(c)~Patients were blinded.
(d)~Double-blind with respect to the researchers evaluating the patients, but the nurses who briefly interacted with patients during the distribution of the medication were not blinded. We could say the study was partly double-blind.
(e)~No. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups and were blinded, so we would expect about an equal number of patients in each group to not adhere to the treatment.}

% 29
\eocesol{Recruit 30 friends and randomly assign them to three groups: no music, instrumental music, and music with lyrics. Have each participant read a passage to learn about a new concept, and then give them a short quiz assessing what they have learned. Compare the number of questions participants got correct on average across the three groups.}

\eocesol{(a) Experiment.
(b)~Treatment is exercise twice a week. Control is no exercise. 
(c)~Yes, the blocking variable is age.
(d)~No.
(e)~This is an experiment, so a causal conclusion is reasonable. Since the sample is random, the conclusion can be generalized to the population at large. However, we must consider that a placebo effect is possible. 
(f)~Yes. Randomly sampled people should not be required to participate in a clinical trial, and there are also ethical concerns about the plan to instruct one group not to participate in a healthy behavior, which in this case is exercise.}

% 33
\eocesol{(a) (i) Observational study. (ii) There is random sampling. (iii) There is no random assignment. (iv) Since only random sampling from a known population is performed, one may infer the characteristics of the sample tend to mirror corresponding characteristics of the population. Therefore, we can say that among high school students those who do not watch TV while doing homework tend to do better on average. However we cannot infer causation based on this study. (v) Neither stratifying nor blocking was used in this study. 
(b) (i) Observational study. (ii) There is random sampling. (iii) There is no random assignment. (iv) Since only random sampling from a known population is performed, one may infer the characteristics of the sample tend to mirror corresponding characteristics of the population. Therefore, we can say that among high school males and females those who do not watch TV while doing homework tend to do better on average. However we cannot infer causation based on this study. (v) Stratifying (separating into groups during the process of sampling) is used but no blocking.
(c) (i) Experiment. (ii) There is random sampling. (iii) There is random assignment. (iv) Since both random sampling and random assignment to groups are performed, one may draw cause-effect inferences about the sample results, as well as generalize to the larger population from which the sample was drawn. Therefore, we can say that there appears to be a cause-and-effect relationship between watching TV while doing homework and low grade point averages. (v) Neither stratifying nor blocking was used in this study.

% 35
\eocesol{A sample of everyone in your homeroom class is not a random sample of all high schoolers, therefore findings from this study should not be generalized to all high schoolers. Also, this is an observational study with no random assignment, therefore causal inferences cannot be drawn.}

% 37
\eocesol{Match subjects on attributes that might be associated with running faster: age, height, weight, fitness level, running experience, etc. Then, randomly assign one student from each pair to consume a sports drink that replenishes electrolytes and the other to consume a placebo drink (a drink that looks and tastes the same but does not replenish electrolytes). Then, time the students running the same pre-specified distance (e.g. 1 mile) and compare the average finishing times for the two groups.}

% 39
\eocesol{Design~B is the most appropriate since there are an equal number of cups from each group at each of the possible distances from the window (2~cups from each group are next to the window, 2~cups from each group are middle distance from the window, 2~cups from each group are far from the window). This is important since the amount of sunlight is likely an important factor in the plants' growth.}

\eocesol{(a)~Decrease: the new score is smaller than the mean of the 24 previous scores.
(b)~Calculate a weighted mean. Use a weight of 24 for the old mean and 1 for the new mean: $(24\times 74 + 1\times64)/(24+1) = 73.6$. There are other ways to solve this exercise that do not use a weighted mean.
(c)~The new score is more than 1 standard deviation away from the previous mean, so increase.}

% 13
\eocesol{Both distributions are right skewed and bimodal with modes at 10 and 20 cigarettes; note that people may be rounding their answers to half a pack or a whole pack. The median of each distribution is between 10 and 15 cigarettes. The middle 50\% of the data (the IQR) appears to be spread equally in each group and have a width of about 10 to 15. There are potential outliers above 40 cigarettes per day. It appears that respondents who smoke only a few cigarettes (0 to 5) smoke more on the weekdays than on weekends.}

\eocesol{Descriptions will vary a little. (a)~2. Unimodal, symmetric, centered at 60, standard deviation of roughly 3.
(b)~3. Symmetric and approximately evenly distributed from 0 to 100.
(c)~1. Right skewed, unimodal, centered at about 1.5, with most observations falling between 0 and 3. A very small fraction of observations exceed a value of 5.}

% 23
\eocesol{The histogram shows that the distribution is bimodal, which is not apparent in the box plot. The box plot makes it easy to identify more precise values of observations outside of the whiskers.}

% 25
\eocesol{(a) Both distributions are right skewed however the distribution of incomes of males has a much higher median (around \$40K) compared to females (around \$20K).
(b) We could also use side-by-side box plots for displaying and easily comparing the distributions of incomes of males and females.
}

% 27
\eocesol{(a) The distribution of number of pets per household is likely right skewed as there is a natural boundary at 0 and only a few people have many pets. Therefore the center would be best described by the median, and variability would be best described by the IQR.
(b) The distribution of number of distance to work is likely right skewed as there is a natural boundary at 0 and only a few people live a very long distance from work. Therefore the center would be best described by the median, and variability would be best described by the IQR.
(c) The distribution of heights of males is likely symmetric. Therefore the center would be best described by the mean, and variability would be best described by the standard deviation.
}

% 29
\eocesol{No, we would expect this distribution to be right skewed. There are two reasons for this: (1) there is a natural boundary at 0 (it is not possible to watch less than 0 hours of TV), (2) the standard deviation of the distribution is very large compared to the mean.}

% 31
\eocesol{The statement ``50\% of Facebook users have over 100 friends" means that the median number of friends is 100, which is lower than the mean number of friends (190), which suggests a right skewed distribution for the number of friends of Facebook users.}

% 33
\eocesol{(a) The median is better; the mean is substantially affected by the two extreme observations.
(b) The IQR is better; the standard deviation, like the mean, is substantially affected by the two high salaries.}

% 35
\eocesol{The distribution is unimodal and symmetric with a mean of about 25 minutes and a standard deviation of about 5 minutes. There does not appear to be any counties with unusually high or low mean travel times. Since the distribution is already unimodal and symmetric, a log transformation is not necessary.}

% 37
\eocesol{mean = $65,090 \times 1.05 = 68,344.50$; median = $65,240 \times 1.05 = 68,502$; sd = $2,122 \times 1.05 = 2,228.10$}

\eocesol{mean = 16 - 3 = 13; sd = 4.18}

% 41
\eocesol{Answers will vary. There are pockets of longer travel time around DC, Southeastern NY, Chicago, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and many other big cities. There is also a large section of shorter average commute times that overlap with farmland in the Midwest. Many farmers' homes are adjacent to their farmland, so their commute would be 0 minutes, which may explain why the average commute time for these counties is relatively low.}

% 43
\eocesol{(a)~We see the order of the categories and the relative frequencies in the bar plot.
(b)~There are no features that are apparent in the pie chart but not in the bar plot.
(c)~We usually prefer to use a bar plot as we can also see the relative frequencies of the categories in this graph.}

% 45
\eocesol{(a) False. Instead of comparing counts, we should compare percentages.
(b)~True.
(c) False. We cannot infer a causal relationship from an association in an observational study. However, we can say the drug a person is on affects his risk in this case, as he chose that drug and his choice may be associated with other variables, which is why part~(b) is true. The difference in these statements is subtle but important.
(d)~True.}

% 47
\eocesol{(a) Proportion who had heart attack: $\frac{7,979}{227,571} \approx 0.035$
(b) Expected number of cardiovascular problems in the rosiglitazone group if having cardiovascular problems and treatment were independent can be calculated as the number of patients in that group multiplied by the overall rate of cardiovascular problems in the study: $\text{67,593} \times \frac{\text{7,979}}{\text{227,571}} \approx 2370$.
(c-i) $H_0$: Independence model. The treatment and cardiovascular problems are independent. They have no relationship, and the difference in incidence rates between the rosiglitazone and pioglitazone groups is due to chance.
$H_A$: Alternate model. The treatment and cardiovascular problems are not independent. The difference in the incidence rates between the rosiglitazone and pioglitazone groups is not due to chance, and rosiglitazone is associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems.
(c-ii) A higher number of patients with cardiovascular problems in the rosiglitazone group than expected under the assumption of independence would provide support for the alternative hypothesis. This would suggest that rosiglitazone increases the risk of such problems.
(c-iii) In the actual study, we observed 2,593 cardiovascular events in the rosiglitazone group. In the 1,000 simulations under the independence model, we observed somewhat less than 2,593 in all simulations, which suggests that the actual results did not come from the independence model. That is, the analysis provides strong evidence that the variables are not independent, and we reject the independence model in favor of the alternative. The study's results provide strong evidence that rosiglitazone is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems.}

(b)~When the sample size is small, the sampling distribution is right skewed, just like the population distribution. As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution gets more unimodal, symmetric, and approaches normality. The variability also decreases. This is consistent with the Central Limit Theorem.}

(d)~Even though the population distribution is not normal, the conditions for inference are reasonably satisfied, with the possible exception of skew. If the skew isn't very strong (we should ask to see the data), then we can use the Central Limit Theorem to estimate this probability. For now, we'll assume the skew isn't very strong, though the description suggests it is at least moderate to strong. Use $N(1.3, SD_{\bar{x}} = 0.3/\sqrt{60})$: $Z=2.58$ $\to$ 0.0049.

\eocesol{(a)~We cannot use the normal model for this calculation, but we can use the histogram. About 500 songs are shown to be longer than 5 minutes, so the probability is about $500/3000 = 0.167$.
(b)~Two different answers are reasonable. $^{Option~1}$Since the population distribution is only slightly skewed to the right, even a small sample size will yield a nearly normal sampling distribution. We also know that the songs are sampled randomly and the sample size is less than 10\% of the population, so the length of one song in the sample is independent of another.  We are looking for the probability that the total length of 15 songs is more than 60 minutes, which means that the average song should last at least $60/15 = 4$ minutes. Using $SD_{\bar{x}}=1.63/\sqrt{15}$, $Z=1.31$ $\to$ 0.0951. $^{Option~2}$Since the population distribution is not normal, a small sample size may not be sufficient to yield a nearly normal sampling distribution.

To proceed, we must make this strong assumption, though we should note this assumption in any reported results.

There isn't a clear reason why this distribution would be skewed, and since the normal quantile plot looks reasonable, we can mark this condition as reasonably satisfied.
(d)~$T = 4.94$ for $df=10-1=9$ $\to$ p-value $<0.01$.
(e)~Since p-value $<$ 0.05, reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that the average number of cars at the intersection is higher on Friday the 6$^{\text{th}}$ than on Friday the 13$^{\text{th}}$. (We might believe this intersection is representative of all roads, i.e. there is higher traffic on Friday the 6$^{\text{th}}$ relative to Friday the 13$^{\text{th}}$. However, we should be cautious of the required assumption for such a generalization.)
(f)~If the average number of cars passing the intersection actually was the same on Friday the 6$^{\text{th}}$ and $13^{th}$, then the probability that we would observe a test statistic so far from zero is less than 0.01.
(g)~We might have made a Type~I error, i.e. incorrectly rejected the null hypothesis.}

The data provide strong evidence that the average number of traffic accident related emergency room admissions are different between Friday the 6$^{\text{th}}$ and Friday the 13$^{\text{th}}$.

(c)~This is an observational study, not an experiment, so we cannot so easily infer a causal intervention implied by this statement. It is true that there is a difference.

\eocesol{Let $\mu_{diff} = \mu_{pre} - \mu_{post}$. $H_0: \mu_{diff} = 0$: Treatment has no effect. $H_A: \mu_{diff} > 0$: Treatment is effective in reducing Pd T scores, the average pre-treatment score is higher than the average post-treatment score. Note that the reported values are pre minus post, so we are looking for a positive difference, which would correspond to a reduction in the psychopathic deviant T score. Conditions are checked as follows. Independence: The subjects are randomly assigned to treatments, so the patients in each group are independent. All three sample sizes are smaller than 30, so we use $t$-tests. Distributions of differences are somewhat skewed. The sample sizes are small, so we cannot reliably relax this assumption. (We will proceed, but we would not report the results of this specific analysis, at least for treatment group 1.) For all three groups: $df=13$. $T_1= 1.89$ ($0.025<$ p-value $<0.05$), $T_2=1.35$ (p-value = 0.10), $T_3 = -1.40$ (p-value $>0.10$). The only significant test reduction is found in Treatment 1, however, we had earlier noted that this result might not be reliable due to the skew in the distribution. Note that the calculation of the p-value for Treatment 3 was unnecessary: the sample mean indicated a increase in Pd T scores under this treatment (as opposed to a decrease, which was the result of interest). That is, we could tell without formally completing the hypothesis test that the p-value would be large for this treatment group.}

\eocesol{(a)~The relationship is positive, weak, and possibly linear. However, there do appear to be some anomalous observations along the left where several students have the same height that is notably far from the cloud of the other points. Additionally, there are many students who appear not to have driven a car, and they are represented by a set of points along the bottom of the scatterplot.
(b)~There is no obvious explanation why simply being tall should lead a person to drive faster. However, one confounding factor is gender. Males tend to be taller than females on average, and personal experiences (anecdotal) may suggest they drive faster. If we were to follow-up on this suspicion, we would find that sociological studies confirm this suspicion.
(c)~Males are taller on average and they drive faster. The gender variable is indeed an important confounding variable.}

\eocesol{(a)~There is a somewhat weak, positive, possibly linear relationship between the distance traveled and travel time. There is clustering near the lower left corner that we should take special note of.
(b)~Changing the units will not change the form, direction or strength of the relationship between the two variables. If longer distances measured in miles are associated with longer travel time measured in minutes, longer distances measured in kilometers will be associated with longer travel time measured in hours.
(c)~Changing units doesn't affect correlation: $r = 0.636$.}

\eocesol{In each part, we may write the husband ages as a linear function of the wife ages: (a) $age_{H} = age_{W} + 3$; (b) $age_{H} = age_{W} - 2$; and (c) $age_{H} = 2 \times age_{W}$. Since the slopes are positive and these are perfect linear relationships, the correlation will be exactly 1 in all three parts. An alternative way to gain insight into this solution is to create a mock data set, such as a data set of 5 women with ages 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30 (or some other set of ages). Then, based on the description, say for part (a), we can compute their husbands' ages as 29, 30, 31, 32, and 33. We can plot these points to see they fall on a straight line, and they always will. The same approach can be applied to the other parts as well.}

\eocesol{(a)~There is a positive, very strong, linear association between the number of tourists and spending.
(b)~Explanatory: number of tourists (in thousands). Response: spending (in millions of US dollars).
(c)~We can predict spending for a given number of tourists using a regression line. This may be useful information for determining how much the country may want to spend in advertising abroad, or to forecast expected revenues from tourism.
(d)~Even though the relationship appears linear in the scatterplot, the residual plot actually shows a nonlinear relationship. This is not a contradiction: residual plots can show divergences from linearity that can be difficult to see in a scatterplot. A simple linear model is inadequate for modeling these data. It is also important to consider that these data are observed sequentially, which means there may be a hidden structure that it is not evident in the current data but that is important to consider.}

\eocesol{(a)~First calculate the slope: $b_1 = R\times s_y/s_x = 0.636\times113/99 = 0.726$. Next, make use of the fact that the regression line passes through the point $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$: $\bar{y} = b_0 + b_1 \times \bar{x}$. Plug in $\bar{x}$, $\bar{y}$, and $b_1$, and solve for $b_0$: 51. Solution: $\widehat{travel~time} = 51 + 0.726 \times distance$.
(b)~$b_1$: For each additional mile in distance, the model predicts an additional 0.726 minutes in travel time. $b_0$: When the distance traveled is 0 miles, the travel time is expected to be 51 minutes. It does not make sense to have a travel distance of 0 miles in this context. Here, the $y$-intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself.
(c)~$R^2 = 0.636^2 = 0.40$. About 40\% of the variability in travel time is accounted for by the model, i.e. explained by the distance traveled.
(d)~$\widehat{travel~time} =  51 + 0.726 \times distance = 51 + 0.726 \times 103 \approx 126$ minutes. (Note: we should be cautious in our predictions with this model since we have not yet evaluated whether it is a well-fit model.)
(e)~$e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i = 168 - 126 = 42$ minutes. A positive residual means that the model underestimates the travel time.
(f)~No, this calculation would require extrapolation.}

\eocesol{There is an upwards trend. However, the variability is higher for higher calorie counts, and it looks like there might be two clusters of observations above and below the line on the right, so we should not fit a linear model to these data.}

(b)~Expected murder rate in metropolitan areas with no poverty is -29.901 per million. This is obviously not a meaningful value, it just serves to adjust the height of the regression line.
(c)~For each additional percentage increase in poverty, we expect murders per million to be higher on average by 2.559.
(d)~Poverty level explains 70.52\% of the variability in murder rates in metropolitan areas.

\eocesol{(a)~There is an outlier in the bottom right. Since it is far from the center of the data, it is a point with high leverage. It is also an influential point since, without that observation, the regression line would have a very different slope. \\
(b)~There is an outlier in the bottom right. Since it is far from the center of the data, it is a point with high leverage. However, it does not appear to be affecting the line much, so it is not an influential point. \\
(c)~The observation is in the center of the data (in the x-axis direction), so this point does \emph{not} have high leverage. This means the point won't have much effect on the slope of the line and so is not an influential point.}

There is one outlier: a state where 100\% of the population is urban. The variability in the percent of homeownership also increases as we move from left to right in the plot.
(b)~The outlier is located in the bottom right corner, horizontally far from the center of the other points, so it is a point with high leverage. It is an influential point since excluding this point from the analysis would greatly affect the slope of the regression line.}

\eocesol{(a)~The relationship is positive, moderate-to-strong, and linear. There are a few outliers but no points that appear to be influential.
(b)~$\widehat{weight} = -105.0113 + 1.0176 \times height$. Slope: For each additional centimeter in height, the model predicts the average weight to be 1.0176 additional kilograms (about 2.2 pounds).  Intercept: People who are 0 centimeters tall are expected to weigh -105.0113 kilograms. This is obviously not possible. Here, the $y$-intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself.
(c)~$H_A$: The true slope coefficient of height is zero ($\beta_1 = 0$). $H_0$: The true slope coefficient of height is greater than zero ($\beta_1 > 0$). A two-sided test would also be acceptable for this application. The p-value for the two-sided alternative hypothesis ($\beta_1 \ne 0$) is incredibly small, so the p-value for the one-sided hypothesis will be even smaller. That is, we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that height and weight are positively correlated. The true slope parameter is indeed greater than~0.
(d)~$R^2 = 0.72^2 = 0.52$. Approximately 52\% of the variability in weight can be explained by the height of individuals.}

\eocesol{(a)~$H_0$: $\beta_1 = 0$. $H_A$: $\beta_1 > 0$. A two-sided test would also be acceptable for this application. The p-value, as reported in the table, is incredibly small. Thus, for a one-sided test, the p-value will also be incredibly small, and we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that wives' and husbands' heights are positively correlated.
(b)~$\widehat{height}_{W} = 43.5755 + 0.2863 \times height_{H}$.
(c)~Slope: For each additional inch in husband's height, the average wife's height is expected to be an additional 0.2863 inches on average. Intercept: Men who are 0 inches tall are expected to have wives who are, on average, 43.5755 inches tall. The intercept here is meaningless, and it serves only to adjust the height of the line.
(d)~The slope is positive, so $r$ must also be positive. $r = \sqrt{0.09} = 0.30$.
(e)~63.2612. Since $R^2$ is low, the prediction based on this regression model is not very reliable.
(f)~No, we should avoid extrapolating.}

\eocesol{(a)~$r = \sqrt{0.28} \approx -0.53$, we know the correlation is negative due to the negative association shown in the scatterplot.

\eocesol{(a)~$H_0: \beta_1 = 0; H_A: \beta_1 \ne 0$
(b)~The p-value for this test is approximately 0, therefore we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that poverty percentage is a significant predictor of murder rate.
(c)~$n = 20, df = 18, T^*_{18} =  2.10$; $2.559 \pm 2.10 \times 0.390 = (1.74, 3.378)$; For each percentage point poverty is higher, murder rate is expected to be higher on average by 1.74 to 3.378 per million.
(d)~Yes, we rejected $H_0$ and the confidence interval does not include 0.}

% 43

\eocesol{This is a one-sided test, so the p-value should be half of the p-value given in the regression table, which will be approximately 0. Therefore the data provide convincing evidence that poverty percentage is positively associated with murder rate.}

% 45

\eocesol{(a)~The relationship is positive, non-linear, and somewhat strong. Due to the non-linear form of the relationship and the clear non-constant variance in the residuals, a linear model is not appropriate for modeling the relationship between year and price.
(b)~The logged model is a much better fit: the scatter plot shows a linear relationships and the residuals do not appear to have a pattern.
(c)~For each year increase in the year of the truck (for each year the truck is newer) we would expect the price of the truck to increase on average by a factor of $e^{0.137} \approx 1.15$, i.e. by 15\%.}
