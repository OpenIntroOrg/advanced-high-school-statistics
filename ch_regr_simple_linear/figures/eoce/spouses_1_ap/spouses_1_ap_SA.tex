(a)~The association between women's ages and ages of their spouse is positive, 
weak, and linear. There are a few potential outliers: a woman in her mid 40s marrying a person in their early-to-mid 30s , a woman in her early-to-mid 50s marrying a person in their early 40s, and a woman in her early 30s marrying a person in their early 50s.
(b)~The association between women's heights and heights of their spouse is weak but 
positive.
(c)~The age plot, where there is a more evident linear trend in the 
data.
(d)~No. Correlation is unaffected by such rescaling.
