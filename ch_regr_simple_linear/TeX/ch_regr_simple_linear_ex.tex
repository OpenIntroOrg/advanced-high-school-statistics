\eoce{\qt{Beer and blood alcohol content} Many people believe that gender, weight, drinking habits, and many other factors are much more important in predicting blood alcohol content (BAC) than simply considering the number of drinks a person consumed. Here we examine data from sixteen student volunteers at Ohio State University who each drank a randomly assigned number of cans of beer. These students were evenly divided between men and women, and they differed in weight and drinking habits. Thirty minutes later, a police officer measured their blood alcohol content (BAC) in grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood.\footfullcite{Malkevitc+Lesser:2008} The scatterplot and regression table summarize the findings. \\

\item Describe the relationship between the number of cans of beer and BAC.
\item Write the equation of the regression line. Interpret the slope and intercept in context.
\item Do the data provide strong evidence that drinking more cans of beer is associated with an increase in blood alcohol? State the null and alternative hypotheses, report the p-value, and state your conclusion.
\item The correlation coefficient for number of cans of beer and BAC is 0.89. Calculate $R^2$ and interpret it in context.
\item Suppose we visit a bar, ask people how many drinks they have had, and also take their BAC. Do you think the relationship between number of drinks and BAC would be as strong as the relationship found in the Ohio State study?

\eoce{\qt{Rate my professor} Many college courses conclude by giving students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor anonymously. However, the use of these student evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of non-teaching related characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the instructor. Researchers at University of Texas, Austin collected data on teaching evaluation score (higher score means better) and standardized beauty score (a score of 0 means average, negative score means below average, and a positive score means above average) for a sample of 463 professors.\footfullcite{Hamermesh:2005} The scatterplot below shows the relationship between these variables, and also provided is a regression output for predicting teaching evaluation score from beauty score.

\eoce{\qt{Babies} Is the gestational age (time between conception and birth) of a low birth-weight baby useful in predicting head circumference at birth? Twenty-five low birth-weight babies were studied at a Harvard teaching hospital; the investigators calculated the regression of head circumference (measured in centimeters) against gestational age (measured in weeks). The estimated regression line is
\[ \widehat{head\_\hspace{0.3mm}circumference} = 3.91 + 0.78 \times gestational\_\hspace{0.3mm}age \]
\begin{parts}
\item What is the predicted head circumference for a baby whose gestational age is 28 weeks?
\item The standard error for the coefficient of gestational age is 0.35, which is associated with $df=23$. Does the model provide strong evidence that gestational age is significantly associated with head circumference?

Make sure to include the appropriate p-value for this hypothesis test in your answer.
