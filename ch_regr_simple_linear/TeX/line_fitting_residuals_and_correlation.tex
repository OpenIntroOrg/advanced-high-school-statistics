\eoce{\qt{Visualize the residuals\label{visualize_residuals}}

during several years for a Statistics course at a university.

\item Based on these graphs, which of the two exams has the strongest 
correlation with the final exam grade? Explain.

\eoce{\qt{Spouses, Part I\label{husbands_wives_correlation}}
The Great Britain Office of Population Census and Surveys once 
collected data on a random sample of 170 married women in 
Britain, recording the age (in years) and heights (converted 
here to inches) of the women and their spouses.\footfullcite{Hand:1994} 
The scatterplot on the left shows the spouse's age plotted against the woman's age, and the plot on the right shows spouse's height 
plotted against the woman's height.

\item Describe the relationship between the ages of women in the sample and their spouses' ages.
\item Describe the relationship between the heights of women in the sample and their spouses' heights.
\item Which plot shows a stronger correlation? Explain your reasoning.
\item Data on heights were originally collected in centimeters, and 
then converted to inches. Does this conversion affect the correlation 
between heights of women in the sample and their spouses' heights?

\eoce{\qt{Speed and height\label{speed_height_gender}} 1,302 UCLA students 
were asked to fill out a survey where they were asked about their height, 
fastest speed they have ever driven, and gender. The scatterplot on the

the scatterplot on the right displays the breakdown by gender in 
this relationship.

\eoce{\qt{Crawling babies, Part I\label{crawling_babies_corr_units}}  
A study conducted at the University of Denver investigated whether babies 
take longer to learn to crawl in cold months, when they are often bundled 
in clothes that restrict their movement, than in warmer months.
\footfullcite{Benson:1993} Infants born during the study year were split 
into twelve groups, one for each birth month. We consider the average 
crawling age of babies in each group against the average temperature when 
the babies are six months old (that's when babies often begin trying to 
crawl). Temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit (\degree F) and age 
is measured in weeks.\vspace{2mm}

\item Describe the relationship between temperature and crawling age.
\item How would the relationship change if temperature was measured in 
degrees Celsius (\degree C) and age was measured in months?
\item The correlation between temperature in \degree F and age in weeks 
was $r=-0.70$. If we converted the temperature to \degree C and age to 
months, what would the correlation be?
