is associated with an increase in weight? State the null and alternative 
hypotheses, report the p-value, and state your conclusion.

\eoce{\qt{Beer and blood alcohol content\label{beer_blood_alcohol_inf}} 
Many people believe that gender, 
weight, drinking habits, and many other factors are much more important 
in predicting blood alcohol content (BAC) than simply considering the 
number of drinks a person consumed. Here we examine data from sixteen 
student volunteers at Ohio State University who each drank a randomly 
assigned number of cans of beer. These students were different genders, and they differed in weight and drinking habits. 
Thirty minutes later, a police officer measured their blood alcohol 
content (BAC) in grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood.
\footfullcite{Malkevitc+Lesser:2008} The scatterplot and regression 
table summarize the findings.

\item Describe the relationship between the number of cans of beer 
and BAC.
\item Write the equation of the regression line. Interpret the slope 
and intercept in context.
\item Do the data provide strong evidence that drinking more cans of 
beer is associated with an increase in blood alcohol? State the null 
and alternative hypotheses, report the p-value, and state your 
conclusion.
\item The correlation coefficient for number of cans of beer and BAC 
is 0.89. Calculate $R^2$ and interpret it in context.
\item Suppose we visit a bar, ask people how many drinks they have had, 
and also take their BAC. Do you think the relationship between number 
of drinks and BAC would be as strong as the relationship found in the 
Ohio State study?

\eoce{\qt{Spouses, Part II\label{husbands_wives_height_inf}} The 
scatterplot below summarizes womens' heights and their spouses' heights for a random 
sample of 170 married women in Britain, where both partners' ages are 
below 65 years. Summary output of the least squares fit for predicting 
spouse's height from the woman's height is also provided in the table.

\item Is there strong evidence in this sample that taller women have taller spouses? 
State the hypotheses and include any information used to conduct the test.
\item Write the equation of the regression line for predicting the height of a woman's spouse based on the woman's height.
\item Interpret the slope and intercept in the context of the application.
\item Given that $R^2 = 0.09$, what is the correlation of heights 
in this data set?
\item You meet a married woman from Britain who is 5'9" (69 inches). 
What would you predict her spouse's height to be? How reliable is this 
prediction?
\item You meet another married woman from Britain who is 6'7" (79 inches). 
Would it be wise to use the same linear model to predict her spouse's 
height? Why or why not?

\eoce{\qt{Babies\label{babies_head_gestation_inf}} Is the gestational age 
(time between conception and birth) of a low birth-weight baby useful 
in predicting head circumference at birth? Twenty-five low birth-weight 
babies were studied at a Harvard teaching hospital; the investigators 
calculated the regression of head circumference (measured in centimeters) 
against gestational age (measured in weeks). The estimated regression 
line is
\[ \widehat{head~circumference} = 3.91 + 0.78 \times gestational~age \]
\begin{parts}
\item What is the predicted head circumference for a baby whose 
gestational age is 28 weeks?
\item The standard error for the coefficient of gestational age is 0.
35, which is associated with $df=23$. Does the model provide strong 
evidence that gestational age is significantly associated with head 
circumference?
