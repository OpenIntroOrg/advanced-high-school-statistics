\eoce{\qt{Roulette winnings\label{roulette_winnings}} In the game of roulette, a 
wheel is spun and you place bets on where it will stop. One popular bet is 
that it will stop on a red slot; such a bet has an 18/38 chance of winning. 
If it stops on red, you double the money you bet. If not, you lose the money 
you bet. Suppose you play 3 times, each time with a \$1 bet. Let Y represent 
the total amount won or lost. Write a probability model for Y.

\eoce{\qt{University admissions\label{university_admissions}} Suppose a university 
announced that it admitted 2,500 students for the following year's freshman 
class. However, the university has dorm room spots for only 1,786 freshman 
students. If there is a 70\% chance that an admitted student will decide to 
accept the offer and attend this university, what is the approximate 
probability that the university will not have enough dormitory room spots for 
the freshman class?

\eoce{\qt{Speeding on the I-5, Part II\label{speeding_i5_geometric}} 
Exercise~\ref{speeding_i5_intro} states that the distribution of speeds of 
cars traveling on the Interstate 5 Freeway (I-5) in California is nearly 
normal with a mean of 72.6 miles/hour and a standard deviation of 4.78 
miles/hour. The speed limit on this stretch of the I-5 is 70 miles/hour.

\eoce{\qt{Buying books on Ebay\label{buy_boooks_ebay}} The textbook you need to buy 
for your chemistry class is expensive at the college bookstore, so you 
consider buying it on Ebay instead. A look at past auctions suggest that the 
prices of that chemistry textbook have an approximately normal distribution 
with mean \$89 and standard deviation \$15. 
\begin{parts}

\item What is the probability that a randomly selected auction for this book 
closes at more than \$100?

\item Ebay allows you to set your maximum bid price so that if someone 
outbids you on an auction you can automatically outbid them, up to the 
maximum bid price you set. If you are only bidding on one auction, what are 
the advantages and disadvantages of setting a bid price too high or too low? 
What if you are bidding on multiple auctions?

\item If you watched 10 auctions, roughly what percentile might you use for a 
maximum bid cutoff to be somewhat sure that you will win one of these ten 
auctions? Is it possible to find a cutoff point that will ensure that you win 
an auction?

\item If you are willing to track up to ten auctions closely, about what 
price might you use as your maximum bid price if you want to be somewhat sure 
that you will buy one of these ten books?

    you see who can ride \emph{Batman the Ride} is

Heights of 10 year olds, regardless of gender, closely follow
a normal distribution with mean 55 inches and standard deviation
6~inches.
\begin{parts}
\item
    What fraction of 10 year olds are taller than
    76 inches?
\item\label{heights_10_yrs_dist_76_inches}
    If there are 2,000 10 year olds entering
    Six Flags Magic Mountain in a single day,
    then compute the expected number of
    10 year olds who are at least 76 inches tall.
    (You may assume the heights of the 10-year olds
    are independent.)
\item
    Using the binomial distribution,
    compute the probability that 0 of the 2,000
    10 year olds will be at least 76 inches tall.
\item
    The number of 10 year olds who enter
    Six Flags Magic Mountain and are
    at least 76 inches tall in a given day
    follows a Poisson distribution with
    mean equal to the value found in
    part~(\ref{heights_10_yrs_dist_76_inches}).
    Use the Poisson distribution to identify
    the probability no 10 year old will enter
    the park who is 76 inches or taller.
