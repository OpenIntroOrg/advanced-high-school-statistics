\begin{parts}
\item Describe the distribution.
\item Sampling distributions for means from simple random samples of 5, 30, and 100 pennies is shown in the histograms below. Describe the shapes of these distributions and comment on whether they look like what you would expect to see based on the Central Limit Theorem.

\eoce{\qt{Ages of pennies, Part II} The mean age of the pennies from Exercise~\ref{penniesAges} is 10.44 years with a standard deviation of 9.2 years. Using the Central Limit Theorem, calculate the means and standard deviations of the distribution of the mean from random samples of size 5, 30, and 100. Comment on whether the sampling distributions shown in Exercise~\ref{penniesAges} agree with the values you compute.

\eoce{\qt{Housing prices, Part I}\label{Topanga} \videohref{ahss_eoce_sol-housing_prices}\ \ A housing survey was conducted to determine the price of a typical home in Topanga, CA. The mean price of a house was roughly \$1.3 million with a standard deviation of \$300,000. There were no houses listed below \$600,000 but a few houses above \$3 million.
\begin{parts}
\item Is the distribution of housing prices in Topanga symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed? \textit{Hint:} Sketch the distribution.
\item Would you expect most houses in Topanga to cost more or less than \$1.3 million?
\item Can we estimate the probability that a randomly chosen house in Topanga costs more than \$1.4 million using the normal distribution?
\item What is the probability that the mean of 60 randomly chosen houses in Topanga is more than \$1.4 million?
\item How would doubling the sample size affect the standard deviation of the mean?

\eoce{\qt{Stats final scores\label{stats_final_scores}} Each year about 1500 students take the introductory statistics course at a large university. This year scores on the final exam are distributed with a median of 74 points, a mean of 70 points, and a standard deviation of 10 points. There are no students who scored above 100 (the maximum score attainable on the final) but a few students scored below 20 points.
\begin{parts}
\item Is the distribution of scores on this final exam symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed?
\item Would you expect most students to have scored above or below 70 points?
\item Can we calculate the probability that a randomly chosen student scored above 75 using the normal distribution?
\item What is the probability that the average score for a random sample of 40 students is above 75?
\item How would cutting the sample size in half affect the standard deviation of the mean?

\eoce{\qt{Identify distributions, Part I} Four plots are presented below. The plot at the top is a distribution for a population. The mean is 10 and the standard deviation is 3. Also shown below is a distribution of (1) a single random sample of 100 values from this population, (2) a distribution of 100 sample means from random samples with size 5, and (3) a distribution of 100 sample means from random samples with size 25. Determine which plot (A, B, or C) is which and explain your reasoning.

\eoce{\qt{Weights of pennies} The distribution of weights of United States pennies is approximately normal with a mean of 2.5 grams and a standard deviation of 0.03 grams.
\begin{parts}
\item What is the probability that a randomly chosen penny weighs less than 2.4 grams?
\item Describe the sampling distribution of the mean weight of 10 randomly chosen pennies.
\item What is the probability that the mean weight of 10 pennies is less than 2.4 grams?
\item Sketch the two distributions (population and sampling) on the same scale.

\eoce{\qt{Spray paint, Part II} As described in Exercise~\ref{sprayPaint}, the area that can be painted using a single can of spray paint is slightly variable and follows a nearly normal distribution with a mean of 25 square feet and a standard deviation of 3 square feet. 
\begin{parts}
\item What is the probability that the area covered by a can of spray paint is more than 27 square feet?
\item Suppose you want to spray paint an area of 540 square feet using 20 cans of spray paint. On average, how many square feet must each can be able to cover to spray paint all 540 square feet?
\item What is the probability that you can cover a 540 square feet area using 20 cans of spray paint?
\item If the area covered by a can of spray paint had a slightly skewed distribution, could you still calculate the probabilities in parts~(a) and~(c) using the normal distribution?

\eoce{\qt{Wireless routers} John is shopping for wireless routers and is overwhelmed by the number of available options. In order to get a feel for the average price, he takes a random sample of 75 routers and finds that the average price for this sample is \$75 and the standard deviation is \$25. 
\begin{parts}
\item Based on this information, how much variability should he expect to see in the mean prices of repeated samples, each containing 75 randomly selected wireless routers?
\item A consumer website claims that the average price of routers is \$80. Is a true average of \$80 consistent with John's sample?

\eoce{\qt{Betting on dinner, Part II} Exercise~\ref{dinnerBet} introduces a promotion at a restaurant where prices of menu items are determined randomly following some underlying distribution. We are told that the price of basket of fries is drawn from a normal distribution with mean 6 and standard deviation of 2. You want to get 5 baskets of fries but you only have \$28 in your pocket. What is the probability that you would have enough money to pay for all five baskets of fries?}
