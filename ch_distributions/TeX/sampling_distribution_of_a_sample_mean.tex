% 8 - ages_pennies_2

\eoce{\qt{Ages of pennies, Part II\label{ages_pennies_2}} The mean age of the pennies from Exercise~\ref{penniesAges} is 10.44 years with a standard deviation of 9.2 years. Using the Central Limit Theorem, calculate the means and standard deviations of the distribution of the mean from random samples of size 5, 30, and 100. Comment on whether the sampling distributions shown in Exercise~\ref{penniesAges} agree with the values you compute.

% 9 - housing_prices

\eoce{\qt{Housing prices\label{housing_prices}} \videosolution{ahss_eoce_sol-housing_prices} A housing survey was conducted to 
determine the price of a typical home in Topanga, CA. The mean price of a house 
was roughly \$1.3 million with a standard deviation of \$300,000. There were no 
houses listed below \$600,000 but a few houses above \$3 million.
\begin{parts}
\item Is the distribution of housing prices in Topanga symmetric, right skewed, 
or left skewed? \textit{Hint:} Sketch the distribution.
\item Would you expect most houses in Topanga to cost more or less than \$1.3 
million?
\item Can we estimate the probability that a randomly chosen house in Topanga 
costs more than \$1.4 million using the normal distribution?
\item What is the probability that the mean of 60 randomly chosen houses in 
Topanga is more than \$1.4 million?
\item How would doubling the sample size affect the standard deviation of the 
mean?

% 10 - stats_final_scores

<<<<<<< HEAD
\eoce{\qt{Stats final scores\label{stats_final_scores}} Each year about 1500 students take the introductory statistics course at a large university. This year scores on the final exam are distributed with a median of 74 points, a mean of 70 points, and a standard deviation of 10 points. There are no students who scored above 100 (the maximum score attainable on the final) but a few students scored below 20 points.

distribution of 100 sample means from random samples with size 5, and (3) a 
distribution of 100 sample means from random samples with size 25. Determine 
which plot (A, B, or C) is which and explain your reasoning.

% 17 - wireless_routers

\eoce{\qt{Wireless routers\label{wireless_routers}} John is shopping for wireless routers and is overwhelmed by the number of available options. In order to get a feel for the average price, he takes a random sample of 75 routers and finds that the average price for this sample is \$75 and the standard deviation is \$25. 
\begin{parts}
\item Based on this information, how much variability should he expect to see in the mean prices of repeated samples, each containing 75 randomly selected wireless routers?
\item A consumer website claims that the average price of routers is \$80. Is a true average of \$80 consistent with John's sample?

\eoce{\qt{Betting on dinner, Part II\label{betting_on_dinner_2}} Exercise~\ref{betting_on_dinner_1} introduces a promotion at a restaurant where prices of menu items are determined randomly following some underlying distribution.
