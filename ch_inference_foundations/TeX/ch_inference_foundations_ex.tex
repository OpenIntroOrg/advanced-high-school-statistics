\eoce{\qt{College credits} \label{credits} A college counselor is interested in estimating how many credits a student typically enrolls in each semester. The counselor decides to randomly sample 100 students by using the registrar's database of students. The histogram below shows the distribution of the number of credits taken by these students. Sample statistics for this distribution are also provided.\\

\subsection{Confidence intervals}

\eoce{\qt{Chronic illness, Part I} \label{ChronicIllnessP1}
In 2013, the Pew Research Foundation reported that ``45\% of U.S. adults report that they live with one or more chronic conditions''.\footfullcite{data:pewdiagnosis:2013} However, this value was based on a sample, so it may not be a perfect estimate for the population parameter of interest on its own. The study reported a standard error of about 1.2\%, and a normal model may reasonably be used in this setting. Create a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of U.S. adults who live with one or more chronic conditions. Also interpret the confidence interval in the context of the study.

\eoce{\qt{Twitter users and news, Part I} A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52\% of U.S. adult Twitter users get at least some news on Twitter.\footfullcite{data:pewtwitternews:2013}. The standard error for this estimate was 2.4\%, and a normal distribution may be used to model the sample proportion. Construct a 99\% confidence interval for the fraction of U.S. adult Twitter users who get some news on Twitter, and interpret the confidence interval in context.

\eoce{\qt{Chronic illness, Part II} In 2013, the Pew Research Foundation reported that ``45\% of U.S. adults report that they live with one or more chronic conditions'', and the standard error for this estimate is 1.2\%.
Identify each of the following statements as true or false. Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.
\begin{parts}
\item We can say with certainty that the confidence interval from Exerise~\ref{ChronicIllnessP1} contains the true percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from a chronic illness.
\item If we repeated this study 1,000 times and constructed a 95\% confidence interval for each study, then approximately 950 of those confidence intervals would contain the true fraction of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses.
\item The poll provides statistically significant evidence (at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level) that the percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses is below 50\%.
\item Since the standard error is 1.2\%, only 1.2\% of people in the study communicated uncertainty about their answer.
\end{parts}

% 10

\eoce{\qt{Twitter users and news, Part II} A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52\% of U.S. adult Twitter users get at least some news on Twitter, and the standard error for this estimate was 2.4\%. Identify each of the following statements as true or false. Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.
\begin{parts}
\item The data provide statistically significant evidence that more than half of U.S. adult Twitter users get some news through Twitter. Use a significance level of $\alpha = 0.01$.
\item Since the standard error is 2.4\%, we can conclude that 97.6\% of all U.S. adult Twitter users were included in the study.
\item If we want to reduce the standard error of the estimate, we should collect less data.
\item If we construct a 90\% confidence interval for the percentage of U.S. adults Twitter users who get some news through Twitter, this confidence interval will be wider than a corresponding 99\% confidence interval.

\eoce{\qt{Relaxing after work} The 2010 General Social Survey asked the question: ``After an average work day, about how many hours do you have to relax or pursue activities that you enjoy?" to a random sample of 1,155 Americans.\footfullcite{data:gss:2010} A 95\% confidence interval for the mean number of hours spent relaxing or pursuing activities they enjoy was (1.38, 1.92).
\begin{parts}
\item Interpret this interval in context of the data.
\item Suppose another set of researchers reported a confidence interval with a larger margin of error based on the same sample of 1,155 Americans. How does their confidence level compare to the confidence level of the interval stated above?
\item Suppose next year a new survey asking the same question is conducted, and this time the sample size is 2,500. Assuming that the population characteristics, with respect to how much time people spend relaxing after work, have not changed much within a year. How will the margin of error of the 95\% confidence interval constructed based on data from the new survey compare to the margin of error of the interval stated above?

\eoce{\qt{Take a walk} The Centers for Disease Control monitors the physical activity level of Americans. A recent survey on a random sample of 23,129 Americans yielded a 95\% confidence interval of 61.1\% to 62.9\% for the proportion of Americans who walk for at least 10 minutes per day.
\begin{parts}
\item Interpret this interval in context of the data.
\item Suppose another set of researchers reported a confidence interval with a larger margin of error based on the same sample of 23,129 Americans. How does their confidence level compare to the confidence level of the interval stated above?
\item Suppose next year a new survey asking the same question is conducted, and this time the sample size is 10,000. Assuming that the population characteristics, with respect to walking habits, have not changed much within a year, how will the width of the confidence interval constructed based on data from the new survey compare to the width of the interval stated above?

\eoce{\qt{Women leaders, Part I} \label{womenLeaders} A November 2014 Pew Research poll on women and leadership asked respondents what they believed is holding women back from top jobs. 43\% of the respondents said that women are held to higher standards than men when being considered for top executive business positions. This result is based on 1,835 randomly sampled national adults. \footfullcite{data:pewwomenleaders:2014}
\begin{parts}
\item Construct a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who believe women are held to higher standards than men when being considered for top executive business positions.

\eoce{\qt{Women leaders, Part II}  The poll introduced in Exercise~\ref{womenLeaders} also asked whether respondents expected to see a female president in their lifetime. 78\% of the 1,835 respondents said ``yes".
\begin{parts}
\item Construct a 90\% confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who expect to see a female president in their lifetime, and interpret this interval in context of the data.
\item How would you expect the width of a 98\% confidence interval to compare to the interval you calculated in part (a)? Explain your reasoning.

\subsection{Introducing hypothesis testing}

% 15

\eoce{\qt{Social experiment, Part I} \label{socExpP1} A ``social experiment" conducted by a TV program questioned what people do when they see a very obviously bruised woman getting picked on by her boyfriend. On two different occasions at the same restaurant, the same couple was depicted. In one scenario the woman was dressed ``provocatively'' and in the other scenario the woman was dressed ``conservatively''. The table below shows how many restaurant diners were present under each scenario, and whether or not they intervened.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll cc c} 
			&				& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Scenario}} \\
\cline{3-4}
							&			& Provocative	& Conservative 	& Total	\\
\cline{2-5}
\multirow{2}{*}{\textit{Intervene}}	&Yes 		& 5	 	& 15		& 20 	\\
							&No			& 15	 	& 10 	 	& 25 \\
\cline{2-5}
							&Total		& 20		& 25		& 45 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
A simulation was conducted to test if people react differently under the two scenarios. 10,000 simulated differences were generated to construct the null distribution shown. The value $\hat{p}_{pr, sim}$ represents the proportion of diners who intervened in the simulation for the provocatively dressed woman, and $\hat{p}_{con, sim}$ is the proportion for the conservatively dressed woman.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_props/figures/eoce/socExp/socExp}
\end{center}
\begin{parts}
\item What are the hypotheses? For the purposes of this exercise, you may assume that each observed person at the restaurant behaved independently, though we would want to evaluate this assumption more rigorously if we were reporting these results.
\item Calculate the observed difference between the rates of intervention under the provocative and conservative scenarios: $\hat{p}_{pr} - \hat{p}_{con}$.
\item Estimate the p-value using the figure above and determine the conclusion of the hypothesis test.

\eoce{\qt{Is yawning contagious, Part I} \label{yawningContageousP1} An experiment conducted by the \textit{MythBusters}, a science entertainment TV program on the Discovery Channel, tested if a person can be subconsciously influenced into yawning if another person near them yawns. 50 people were randomly assigned to two groups: 34 to a group where a person near them yawned (treatment) and 16 to a group where there wasn't a person yawning near them (control). The following table shows the results of this experiment. \footfullcite{data:yawn}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll cc c} 
			&				& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Group}} \\
\cline{3-4}
							&			& Treatment	& Control 	& Total	\\
\cline{2-5}
\multirow{2}{*}{\textit{Result}}		&Yawn 		& 10	 	& 4		& 14 	\\
							&Not Yawn	& 24	 	& 12 	 	& 36 \\
\cline{2-5}
							&Total		& 34		& 16		& 50 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
A simulation was conducted to understand the distribution of the test statistic under the assumption of independence: having someone yawn near another person has no influence on if the other person will yawn. In order to conduct the simulation, a researcher wrote yawn on 14 index cards and not yawn on 36 index cards to indicate whether or not a person yawned. Then he shuffled the cards and dealt them into two groups of size 34 and 16 for treatment and control, respectively. He counted how many participants in each simulated group yawned in an apparent response to a nearby yawning person, and calculated the difference between the simulated proportions of yawning as $\hat{p}_{trtmt,sim} - \hat{p}_{ctrl,sim}$. This simulation was repeated 10,000 times using software to obtain 10,000 differences that are due to chance alone. The histogram shows the distribution of the simulated differences.

\eoce{\qt{Social experiment, Part II} In Exercise~\ref{socExpP1}, we encountered a scenario where researchers were evaluating the impact of the way someone is dressed against the actions of people around them. In that exercise, researchers may have believed that dressing provocatively may reduce the chance of bystander intervention. One might be tempted to use a one-sided hypothesis test for this study. Discuss the drawbacks of doing so in 1-3 sentences.

\eoce{\qt{Is yawning contagious, Part II} Exercise~\ref{yawningContageousP1} describes an experiment by Myth Busters, where they examined whether a person yawning would affect whether others to yawn. The traditional belief is that yawning is contagious -- one yawn can lead to another yawn, which might lead to another, and so on. In that exercise, there was the option of selecting a one-sided or two-sided test. Which would you recommend (or which did you choose)? Justify your answer in 1-3 sentences.

\eoce{\qt{The Egyptian Revolution} \label{EgyptianRevolutionEOCE} A popular uprising that started on January 25, 2011 in Egypt led to the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. Polls show that about 69\% of American adults followed the news about the political crisis and demonstrations in Egypt closely during the first couple weeks following the start of the uprising. Among a random sample of 30 high school students, it was found that only 17 of them followed the news about Egypt closely during this time. \footfullcite{data:egypt}
\begin{parts}
\item Write the hypotheses for testing if the proportion of high school students who followed the news about Egypt is different than the proportion of American adults who did.
\item Calculate the proportion of high schoolers in this sample who followed the news about Egypt closely during this time.

\eoce{\qt{Assisted Reproduction} \label{AssistedReproductionEOCE} Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is a collection of techniques that help facilitate pregnancy (e.g. in vitro fertilization). A 2008 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that ART has been successful in leading to a live birth in 31\% of cases \footfullcite{web:art}. A new fertility clinic claims that their success rate is higher than average. A random sample of 30 of their patients yielded a success rate of 40\%. A consumer watchdog group would like to determine if this provides strong evidence to support the company's claim.
\begin{parts}
\item Write the hypotheses to test if the success rate for ART at this clinic is significantly higher than the success rate reported by the CDC.
\item Describe a setup for a simulation that would be appropriate in this situation and how the p-value can be calculated using the simulation results.
\item Below is a histogram showing the distribution of $\hat{p}_{sim}$ in 10,000 simulations under the null hypothesis. Estimate the p-value using the plot and use it to evaluate the hypotheses.
\item After performing this analysis, the consumer group releases the following news headline: ``Infertility clinic falsely advertises better success rates". Comment on the appropriateness of this statement.
