This file describes guidelines when the textbook's source files are modified
and / or shared. The CC BY-SA license guidelines supersede any guidelines put
forth here; follow the CC BY-SA license if there is any discrepancy between
that license and these guidelines.

1. Communication obligation. Any derivative work must communicate that
it is licensed under a CC BY-SA license.

2. Figure attribution. Some photographs may be owned by other creators who
made the images available under a Creative Commons license and were used
in this work. If you use a photograph, please check in the textbook whether
the figure is a work of another party. If you use any such images,
provide appropriate attribution to the original photographer
(e.g. see OpenIntro Statistics for what we believe to be appropriate
attribution in these instances).

3. Derivative title. No derivative may include "OpenIntro" in the title,
unless it is included in text of the form "Derivative of OpenIntro".
Additionally, no derivative may be given the title "Advanced High
School Statistics", unless it is included in text of the form
"Derivative of Advanced High School Statistics".

There is one exception to this guideline. If the original textbook PDF
is used to make paper copies the textbook and no modifications
(changes or additions) are made, then the title may be
"Advanced High School Statistics" with a clear designation of the edition.
However, it should also be clearly noted that it is not an official copy
of the textbook; this communicates that the authors have not endorsed
the print product.

Use of the OpenIntro logo is strictly prohibited and is not licensed
for use.

4. Below are other suggested guidelines for attribution.

- The first two pages of any derivative work should be the title page
and the copyright page. We encourage contributors to use the following
two files provided in the textbook's source: file,
extraTeX > preamble > title_derivative.tex, copyright_derivative.tex.

- We advise that contributing authors' names be listed in chronological
order corresponding to their contribution. We also encourage contributing
authors to provide a brief description of their contribution.
